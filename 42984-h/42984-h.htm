<h2><a name="EDITORS_PREFACE" id="EDITORS_PREFACE">EDITOR'S PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>Jeremy Bentham, an eminent English judicial or
jural philosopher, was born in London, February
15, 1748, and died at Westminster, his residence for
six years previously, June 6, 1832. His grandfather
was a London Attorney; his father, who followed
the same profession, was a shrewd man of business,
and added considerably to his patrimony by land
speculations. These London Benthams were probably
an offshoot from an ancient York family of
the same name, which boasted a Bishopric among its
members; but our author did not trouble himself to
trace his genealogy beyond the pawnbroker. His
mother, Alicia Groove, was the daughter of an Andover
shopkeeper. Jeremy, the eldest, and for nine
years the only child of this marriage, was for the
first sixteen years of his life exceedingly puny, small
and feeble. At the same time, he exhibited a remarkable
precocity which greatly stimulated the pride
and affection of his father. At five years of age he
acquired a knowledge of musical notes and learned
to play the violin. At four or earlier, having previously
learned to write, he was initiated into Latin
grammar, and in his seventh year entered Westminster
School. Meanwhile, he was taught French
by a private master at home and at seven read
Telemaque, a book which strongly impressed him.
Learning to dance was a much more serious undertaking,
as he was so weak in his legs.</p>

<p>Young as he was, he acquired distinction at Westminster
as a fabricator of Latin and Greek verses,
the great end and aim of the instruction given there.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</a></span></p>

<p>When twelve years old, he was entered as a Commoner
at Queen's College, Oxford, where he spent
the next three years. Though very uncomfortable
at Oxford, he went through the exercises of the
College with credit and even with some distinction.
Some Latin verses of his, on the accession of George
III, attracted a great deal of attention as the production
of one so young. Into all of the disputations
which formed a part of the College exercises, he entered
with zeal and much satisfaction; yet he never
felt at home in the University because of its historical
monotony, and of all of which he retained
the most unfavorable recollections.</p>

<p>In 1763, while not yet sixteen, he took the degree
of A.B. Shortly after this he began his course of
Law in Lincoln's Inn, and journeyed back and forth
to Oxford to hear Blackstone's Lectures. These
lectures were published and read throughout the
realm of England and particularly in the American
Colonies. These were criticised by the whole school
of Cromwell, Milton and such followers as Priestly
and others in England and many in the Colonies in
America. Young Bentham returned to London and
attended as a student the Court of the King's Bench,
then presided over by Mansfield, of whom he continued
for some years a great admirer.</p>

<p>Among the advocates, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'D'unning's'">Dunning's</ins> clearness, directness
and precision most impressed him. He took
the degree of A.M. at the age of 18, the youngest
graduate that had been known at the Universities;
and in 1772 he was admitted to the Bar.</p>

<p>Young Bentham had breathed from infancy, at
home, at school, at college and in the Courts, an
atmosphere conservative and submissive to authority,
yet in the progress of his law studies, he found
a striking contrast between the structural imperialism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
of the British Empire as expounded by Blackstone
and others of his day, and the philosophical
social state discussed by Aristotle, Plato, Aurelius,
the struggling patriots of France, and the new brotherhood,
then agitating the colonies of America.</p>

<p>His father had hoped to see him Lord-Chancellor,
and took great pains to push him forward. But having
perceived a shocking contrast between the law
as it was under the Church imperial structure and
such as he conceived it ought to be, he gradually
abandoned the position of a submissive and admiring
student and assumed a position among the school
of reformers and afterwards the role of sharp critic
and indignant denouncer.</p>

<p>He heroically suffered privations for several years
in Lincoln's Inn garrett, but persevered in study.
He devoted some of his time to the study of science.
The writings of Hume, Helvetius and others led him
to adopt utility as the basis of Morals and Legislation.
There had developed two distinct parties in
England: The Radicals and Imperialists. The Radicals
contended that the foundation of Legislation
was that utility which produced the greatest happiness
to the greatest number.</p>

<p>Blackstone and the Ecclesiastics had adopted the
theory of Locke, that the foundation of Legislation
was a kind of covenant of mankind to conform to the
laws of God and Nature, as interpreted by hereditarily
self-constituted rulers.</p>

<p>Bentham contended that this was only a vague and
uncertain collection of words well adapted to the
promotion of rule by dogmatic opinions of the Lords
and King and Ecclesiastics in combination well calculated
to deprive the people of the benefits of
popular government. He conceived the idea of
codifying the laws so as to define them in terms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
the greatest good to the greatest number, and devoted
a large share of the balance of his life to this
work.</p>

<p>In 1775 he published a small book in defense of the
policy of Lord North toward the Colonies, but for
fear of prosecution it was issued by one John Lind
and extensively read. A little later he published a
book entitled "A Fragment on Government." This
created a great deal of attention. Readers variously
ascribed the book to Mansfield, to Camden and to
Dunning. The impatient pride of Bentham's father
betrayed this secret. It was variously interpreted
as a philosophical Treatise and a Critical Personal
Attack upon the Government. But he persevered in
the advocacy of his principals of Morals and Government.
He hoped also to be appointed Secretary of
the Commission sent out by Lord North to propose
terms to the revolted American Colonies. But as
King George III had contracted a dislike to him,
he was disappointed in his plan of Conference with
the Colonies. His writings were, however, more
appreciated in France. He was openly espoused as
a philosopher and reformer by D'Alimbert, Castillux,
Brissat and others. But in the meantime some
such men as Lord Shelbourne, Mills and others became
his friends and admirers, and encouraged him
to persevere with his philosophical Code of laws,
largely gleaned from the ancient philosophers of
liberty and equality which had been smothered and
superseded by military and Church imperialism.</p>

<p>In 1785 he took an extensive tour across the Alps
and while at Kricov on the Dou, he wrote his letters
on Usury. These were printed in London, which
were now welcomed by the people largely on account
of his reputation in France as a philosopher of
popular government. In the meantime, Paley had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
printed a treatise on the Principle of applying utility
to morals and legislation. He determined to print
his views in French and address them to that people
then struggling for liberal government.</p>

<p>He revised his sheets on his favorite penal Code
and published them under the title of "An Introduction
to the Principles of Morals and Legislation."
The Principles enunciated in this treatise attracted
the attention of the liberals in France, as well as
England and America. Mirabeau and other French
publishers spread his reputation far and wide.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bentham with the idea of aiding the
deliberations of the States General of France, and
encouraged by the liberals on both continents, and
especially such men as Franklin, Jefferson and
others, printed a "Draft of a Code for the organization
of a Judicial Establishment in France," for
which services the National Assembly conferred on
him the Citizenship of France by a decree, August
23, 1792, in which his name was included with those
of Priestly, Paine, Wilberforce, Clarkson, Mackintosh,
Anacharsis, Clootz, Washington, Klopstock,
Kosiosco, and several others.</p>

<p>In the meantime, in his travels, he conceived an
extensive plan of Prison reform which he strenuously
urged the Crown Officers and the English
Parliament to adopt. After several years of strenuous
labors and the expenditure of a large part of
the patrimony left him by his father, the enterprise
was thwarted by the refusal of the King to concur
with Parliament in the enterprise. This scheme is
fully set forth in the histories of the reign of
George III. But to avoid persecution under the
drastic penal Codes of England, Bentham boasted
that he was a man of no party but a man of all
countries and a fraternal unit of the human race,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
he had come to occupy at home the position of a
party chief.</p>

<p>He espoused with characteristic zeal and enthusiasm
the ideas of the radicals, who, in spite of themselves,
were ranked as a political party. He went,
indeed, the whole length, not merely republicanism,
but on many points of ancient democracy including
Universal Suffrage and the Emancipation of all
Colonies.</p>

<p>No matter how adroitly the Contention was managed,
the Imperialists insisted that it was merely
resurrecting the historic struggle of the days of
Cromwell and his "bare bones." The Church establishment
by way of the Lords and Bishops and
Bishop Lords was the real foundation of the Crown
rule in all its ramifications. This superstructure
was protected by all forms of penal laws against
"lease" Majesty and even the appearance of Church
Creed heresy. The Radicals always confronted by
Crown detectives were compelled to be very wary
in their attacks upon this that they called imperial
idolatry and were compelled to move by indirect
and flank attacks.</p>

<p>The upheaval by Martin Luther in the reign of
Henry VIII at the Council of Trent and others over
the Divine authenticity of the Athanasian Creed
never abated among the humanitarians of England
or France. But in the presence of criminal inquisitions
too barbarous to mention, the Radicals were
handicapped and were compelled to work strategically
and by pits and mines beneath the superstructure
of Church imperialism. The Church structure
as established in Europe is by common consent based
upon the hypothesis of Divinity in the life, works,
and dogmas of one Saul of Tarsus, or as denominated
Paul, or the canonized St. Paul. The substantial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
Creed might well be denominated Paulism.
Hence the legendary Paul has been one of the points
of attack by the rationalists of the centuries.</p>

<p>While many of the contemporaries of Bentham
both in England, America and the Continent denied
the verity of the whole Mosaic cosmogony and historiology,
yet Bentham seemed to ignore this task as
superserviceable and unimportant. He and his
school of Radicals were devoted to the life works
and teachings of Jesus. Jesus was the idol of his
school and he heartily espoused the task of eliminating
Paul as the nemesis of Jesus and his Apostles,
and a character invented and staged by imperialists
to subordinate the toiling classes to the production
of resources to subserve their personal luxuries.</p>

<p>Bentham began writing a philosophic analysis of
the Church's pretensions concerning the divine
agency of Paul. After several years of examination
and study, and while he was writing his famous
treatise entitled "The Rational of Judicial Evidence"
afterwards collected and published by Mill,
he finished the manuscript criticisms of Paul and
entitled them "Not Paul but Jesus."</p>

<p>For fear of prosecution for direct heresy or denunciation
of the Creed of the Church, he evaded
the use of his own name as writer of the Criticism
and used the name of Conyers Middleton, a Cambridge
Divine, who by his writings had created a
great deal of disturbance. He had been convicted
twice for heresy. He had been dead fifty years when
Bentham introduced him in the first lines in the
Introduction to his Criticisms herein published (See
Introduction). Bentham, no doubt, intended
to evade prosecution, as it will be seen that his name
does not appear in the book, and yet at the same
time used the name most obnoxious to the Church
in all its history.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1729 Middleton published his "Letter from
Rome" in which he boldly essayed to demonstrate
that the then religion of the Roman Church was
derived from their heathen ancestral idolaters. He
published other works on the uses of miracles and
prophecy. But Bentham's "Not Paul but Jesus"
did not long remain anonymous. It was read extensively
in France and America. But this treatise
formed a part of the labor of his life, which was
to promote the theory of the social state based upon
"The greatest good to the greatest number, and subordinate
the whole to rational calculations of utility."
These views he continually urged in the form
of Codification so as to eliminate all pretensions of
hierarchical control by historical divine prophets,
the faithful souls and agents of Kings and princes.
In the meantime, he was indefatigable in his attacks
upon the English System of Jurisprudence, which
was being operated in America as a kind of paternal
inheritance. Dumont, in 1811, compiled from the
manuscripts of Bentham a complete code which was
readily adopted in France, because it conformed so
closely to the old Roman procedure which was held
tenaciously in France.</p>

<p>In the meantime, by importunity of Lord Brougham
and others, and particularly of his friends in
America, such as Adams, Franklin and others, he
wrote to Madison offering his services to draw up a
complete code of laws for the United States. Mr.
Madison caused these ideas to be spread broadcast
by pamphlets as pamphleteering was much in vogue
for such purposes in those days. But on account of
our dual form of government, and as the code would
apply to the States separately, the scheme as a whole
failed. But some of the Governors, especially those
of Pennsylvania, Virginia and New Hampshire, got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
hold of the manuscripts and many of the provisions
were adopted and still obtain.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Mr. Mill had collected his manuscripts
on "The Rationale of Judicial Evidence"
and published them in 5 vols. They shortly became a
part of the libraries of the lawyers and statesmen
of England, and especially in the United States. His
manuscripts on "Not Paul but Jesus" were extensively
read and universally admitted to be
rational and sound in point of rational jural demonstration.
During this time, Thomas Jefferson had
been writing on the same subject and after reading
the prints of Bentham, he abandoned the part directed
to the criticism of Paul, but he arranged
chronologically all of the verses from the four gospels
that pertain to the career of Jesus, omitting,
however, every verse or paragraph that to his mind
was ambiguous or controversial, and every statement
of fact that would not have been admitted as
evidence in a Court of Justice. The original copy
of what is denominated as "Jefferson Bible," is
now preserved in the National Museum at Washington.
It was purchased by the Government as a
memento of the author of the Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p>This "The Thomas Jefferson Bible" has lately
been republished by David McKay, 604 S. Washington
Sq., Philadelphia. The treatise "Not Paul
but Jesus" was published in 1825. The printing
art was not as well advanced as at present, and the
division of subjects for discussion and correlation
were not arranged strictly methodically, so the
Editor has rearranged some of the titles with a view
to improve the order of sequence. With this change,
every word has been preserved.</p>

<p>It will all the time be borne in mind that the examination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
is Judicial and the Character Paul had to
be staged from many points of view and examination.
Jeremy Bentham has revolved him in the
limelight of inquisition with a thoroughness that
commands the attention of all thoughtful readers.
With this view the Editor hopes to be justified in
its republication by the reading and inquiring public.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>


<p>Illustrious, in the church of Jesus in general, and
in the church of England in particular, is the name
of <span class="smcap">Conyers Middleton</span>. Signal was, and is, the service
rendered by him to the religion of Jesus. By that
bold, though reverend, hand, it now stands cleared
of many a heap of pernicious rubbish, with which
it had been incumbered and defiled, by the unhallowed
labours of a succession of writers, who,&mdash;without
personal intercourse with the founder, any more
than we have now,&mdash;have, from the mere circumstance
of the comparative vicinity of their days to
those in which he lived, derived the exclusive possession
of the imposing title of <i>Fathers of the
Church</i>, or, in one word, <i>The Fathers</i>.</p>

<p>So able, so effectual, has been this clearance, that,
as it has been observed by the Edinburgh Reviewers,&mdash;speaking
of course of protestants, and more
particularly of English protestants,&mdash;till one unexpected
exception, which it mentions, had presented
itself, they had thought that in no man's opinion
were those writers any "longer to be regarded as
guides, either in faith or morals."</p>

<p>One step further was still wanting. One thorn
still remained, to be plucked out of the side of this
so much injured religion,&mdash;and that was, the addition
made to it by <i>Saul of Tarsus</i>: by that <i>Saul</i>, who,
under the name of <i>Paul</i>, has,&mdash;as will be seen, without
warrant from, and even in the teeth of, the history
of Jesus, as delivered by his companions and
biographers the four evangelists,&mdash;been dignified
with the title of <i>his</i> apostle: his <i>apostle</i>, that is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
say, his <i>emissary</i>: his <i>emissary</i>, that is to say, <i>sent
out</i> by him: sent out, by that Jesus, whose immediate
disciples he so long persecuted and destroyed,
and whose person,&mdash;unless dreaming of a person after
his death, or professing to have dreamt of him,
is seeing him,&mdash;he never saw.</p>

<p>In the course of the ensuing examination, the subject
of <i>miracles</i> has come, unavoidably, under consideration.
On this delicate ground, it has been matter
of no small comfort to the author, to behold precursors,
among divines of different persuasions,
whose reputation for piety has not been diminished
by the spirit of critical inquiry which accompanies
it. Such were Mede, Sykes, and others, whose ingenious
labours were, in the case called that of the
<i>daemoniacs</i>, employed in the endeavor to remove the
supernatural character, from what, in their eyes, was
no more than a natural appearance. On the success
of these their labours, any judgment would here be
irrelevant. Not altogether so the observation, that
in no instance does it appear to him that any such
latitude of interpretation has been employed, as that
which, on that occasion, was found necessary for the
conversion of <i>devils</i> into <i>diseases</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>dissentions</i> which, at all times, have had place
among persons professing the religion of Jesus, are
but too notorious. The <i>mischiefs</i>, produced by these
dissentions, are no less so. These dissentions, and
these mischiefs&mdash;in what have they had their source?
In certain words. These words, of whom have they
been the words? Of Jesus? No: this has not been
so much as pretended. Of Paul, and of Paul alone:
he giving them all along not as the words of Jesus,
but as his own only:&mdash;he all along preaching (as will
be seen) in declared opposition to the eleven who
were undisputedly the apostles of Jesus: thus, of
Paul only have they been the words.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span></p>

<p>That, by these words, and, consequently, by him
whose words they were and are, all the mischiefs,
which have been imputed to <i>the religion of Jesus</i>,
have been produced,&mdash;in so far as the dissentions,
from which these mischiefs flowed, have had these
words for their subjects,&mdash;cannot be denied. But,
moreover, in these same words, that is to say, in the
doctrines delivered by them, cannot but be to be
found the origin, and the cause, of no small part&mdash;perhaps
of the greatest part&mdash;of the <i>opposition</i>,
which <i>that religion, with its benevolent system of
morals</i>, has hitherto experienced. If this be so, then,
by the clearing it of this incumbrance, not only as
yet unexampled purity, but additional extent, may
not unreasonably be expected to be given to it.</p>

<p>It was by the frequent recurrence of these observations,
that the author of these pages was led to the
inquiry, whether the religion of Paul,&mdash;as contained
in the writings ascribed to Paul, and with a degree
of propriety which the author sees no reason to dispute,&mdash;whether
the religion of Paul has any just
title to be considered as forming a part of the religion
of Jesus. The result was in the negative.
The considerations, by which this result was produced,
will form the matter of the ensuing pages.</p>

<p>If, by cutting off a source of useless privations and
groundless terrors, comfort and <i>inward peace</i> should
be restored or secured;&mdash;if, by cutting off a source
of bitter animosity,&mdash;good-will, and peace from
<i>without</i>, should be restored or secured;&mdash;if, by the
removal of an incongruous appendage, acceptance
should be obtained for what is good in the religion
commonly ascribed to Jesus;&mdash;obtained at the hands
of any man, much more of many, to whom at present
it is an object of aversion;&mdash;if, in any one of these
several ways, much more if in all of them, the labours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
of the author should be crowned with success,&mdash;good
service will, so far, and on all hands, be allowed
to have been rendered to mankind.</p>

<p>Whosoever, putting aside all prepossessions, feels
strong enough in mind, to look steadily at the originals,
and from <i>them</i> to take his conceptions of the
matter, not from the discourses of others,&mdash;whosoever
has this command over himself, will recognise,
if the author does not much deceive himself, that by
the two persons in question, as represented in the
two sources of information&mdash;the Gospels and Paul's
Epistles,&mdash;two quite different, if not opposite, religions
are inculcated: and that, in the religion of
Jesus may be found all the <i>good</i> that has ever been
the result of the compound so incongruously and
unhappily made,&mdash;in the religion of Paul, all the
<i>mischief</i>, which, in such disastrous abundance, has
so indisputably flowed from it.</p>

<p>1. That Paul had no such commission as he professed
to have;&mdash;2. that his enterprize was a scheme
of personal ambition, and nothing more;&mdash;3. that his
system of doctrine is fraught with mischief in a variety
of shapes, and, in so far as it departs from, or
adds to, those of Jesus, with good in none;&mdash;and that
it has no warrant, in anything that, as far as appears
from any of the four gospels, was ever said
or done by Jesus;&mdash;such are the conclusions, which
the author of these pages has found himself compelled
to deduce, from those materials with which
history has furnished us. The grounds of these
conclusions he proceeds to submit to the consideration
of his readers.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="PLAN_OF_THE_WORK" id="PLAN_OF_THE_WORK">PLAN OF THE WORK.</a></h2>


<p>The work may be conceived as divided into five
parts.</p>

<p>1. In Part the first, the five different, and in many
respects discordant, accounts given of Paul's conversion,
which, in these accounts, is of course represented
as being not only <i>outward</i> but <i>inward</i>, are
confronted, and, so far as regards inward conversion,
shown to be, all of them, untrue: and, immediately
after, the state of things, which produced,
accompanied, and immediately followed, his outward
conversion,&mdash;together with the time and manner in
which that change was declared,&mdash;is brought to view.
This part occupies the first two chapters.</p>

<p>2. Part the Second is employed in showing,&mdash;that,
from the first commencement, of the intercourse,
which, upon the tokens given of his outward conversion,
took place at Jerusalem between him and
the apostles, Acts 9:27, to the time when,&mdash;in consequence
of the interposition of the Roman commander,
to save him from the unanimous indignation
of the whole people, more particularly of the
disciples of the apostles,&mdash;he was conveyed from
thence under guard to Rome, a space, according to
the commonly received computation, not less than
six and twenty years, (Acts 21 and 23), no supernatural
commission from Jesus, nor any inward conversion,
was,&mdash;either by those distinguished servants
and companions of Jesus, or by their disciples
at Jerusalem,&mdash;believed to have place in his instance.
This part occupies eight chapters: to wit, from the
3d to the 10th inclusive.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span></p>

<p>3. In Part the Third, in further proof of the insincerity
of his character,&mdash;in addition to an oath
proved to be false, are brought to view two unquestionably
false assertions:&mdash;each having for its subject
a matter of prime importance,&mdash;each deliberate
and having in view a particular purpose: the
one, a false account of the number of the witnesses
to the resurrection of Jesus; 1 Cor. 15:6; the other,
a prediction of the end of the world before the death
of persons then living; 1 Thes. 4, 15, 16, 17. This
part occupies Chapters 11 and 12.</p>

<p>4. Part the Fourth is employed in showing,&mdash;that
no proof, of his alleged supernatural commission
from the Almighty, is deducible, from any account
we have, of any of those scenes, in which he is commonly
regarded as having exercised a power of working
miracles. For, that not only he himself never
made exercise of any such power,&mdash;on any of those
occasions, on which the demand for it, for the purpose
of overcoming the disbelief entertained of his
story by the Apostles, was extreme,&mdash;but, neither
on those, nor any other occasions, did he ever take
upon himself to make reference, to so much as any
one instance of any such proof of special authority
from the Almighty, as having been exhibited by him
on any other occasion: that, for the belief in
any such gift, we have no other ground, than the
relations contained in the history called "<i>The Acts
of the Apostles</i>," or, for shortness, <i>The Acts</i>: and
that such throughout is,&mdash;on the one hand, the nature
of the occurrence itself, on the other hand, the
character of the representation given of it,&mdash;that, to
a disbelief in the exercise of any such supernatural
power, it is not necessary that any such imputation
as that of downright and wilful falsehood should be
cast upon the author of that narrative: the occurrences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
in question being, mostly, if not entirely, such
as lie within the ordinary course of nature,&mdash;but,
upon which, either by the fancy, or by the artifice
of the narrator, a sort of supernatural colouring
has been superinduced. For this purpose, these
supposed miracles are, each of them, separately
brought to view and examined. This part occupies
the 13th chapter.</p>

<p>5. Part the Fifth is employed in showing, that,&mdash;even
if, on all these several occasions, the exercise
of a power of producing supernatural effects had,
by unequivocal statements, been ascribed to Paul
by the author of the Acts,&mdash;such testimony, independently
of the virtual contradiction given to it by
the above-mentioned circumstantial evidence,&mdash;could
not, with any propriety, be regarded as affording
adequate proof&mdash;either of the fact of Paul's
having received a divine commission, and thereby,
having become, inwardly as well as outwardly, a
convert to the religion of Jesus&mdash;either of that radical
fact, or so much as of any one of the alleged
achievements, which, upon the face of the accounts in
question, are wont to present themselves as miraculous:
for that, in the first place, it is only by error
that the history in question has been ascribed to
Saint Luke: it being, in respect of the account given
of the circumstances accompanying the ascension of
Jesus, inconsistent with the account given in the
gospel of Saint Luke, when compared with Acts
1:3 to 12,&mdash;and as to those attendant on the death
of Judas, inconsistent with the account in Saint Matthew
27:3 to 10 and Acts 1:16 to 20: and moreover,
such being the whole complexion of his narrative, as
to render it incapable of giving any tolerably adequate
support to any statement whereby the exercise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
of supernatural power is asserted. This part occupies
Chapter 14.</p>

<p>In Part the Sixth, to give additional correctness
and completeness, to the conception supposed to be
conveyed, of the character of Paul and his attendant
historiographer, jointly and severally considered,&mdash;a
conjunct view is given of <i>five</i> reports of his five
trials, as reported in the Acts. This part has been
added since the publication of the above-mentioned
Summary View. It occupies Chapter 15 of the present
work.</p>

<p>Chapter XVI. and last, winds up the whole, with
some general observations on the self-declared oppositeness
of Paul's Gospel, as he calls it, to that of
the Apostles: together with an indication of a real
Antichrist, in compensation for the fabulous one,
created by Paul, and nursed by the episcopal authors
and editors of the Church of England, translators
of the Bible: and by Chapter 12 of the present
work, the imaginary Antichrist is, it is hoped,
strangled.</p>

<p>At the time of the publication of the Summary
View,&mdash;for the more complete and satisfactory demonstration
of the relative insufficiency of the narrative
in question, a short but critical sketch was, as
herein stated, intended to be given, of the parts not
before noticed of the <i>History of the Church</i>,&mdash;from
the ascension of Jesus, being the period at which
that narrative commences, to that at which it terminates,&mdash;to
wit, about two years after the arrival
of Paul at Rome, Acts 28: the history&mdash;to wit, as
deducible from the materials which, in that same
narrative, are brought to view: the duration of the
period being, according to commonly received computations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
about 28 or 30 years<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>: the author of "<i>The
Acts</i>" himself,&mdash;if he is to be believed,&mdash;an eyewitness,
during a considerable portion of the time,
to the several occurrences which he relates.</p>

<p>On this occasion, and for this purpose,&mdash;the history
in question had been sifted, in the same manner
and on the same principles, as any profane history,
in which, in a series of occurrences mostly
natural, a few, wearing a supernatural appearance,
are, here and there, interspersed: as, for instance, in
Livy's, and even in Tacitus's Roman History: on the
one hand, the authority not being regarded as affording
a sufficient foundation, for a belief in the
supernatural parts of the narrative; nor, on the
other hand, the sort of countenance, given to the
supernatural parts, as affording a sufficient reason,
for the disbelief of those, which have nothing in them
that is unconformable to the universally experienced
course of nature.</p>

<p>In respect of <i>doctrine</i>, the conclusion is&mdash;that no
point of doctrine, which has no other authority than
that of Paul's writings for its support, can justly be
regarded as belonging to the religion of Jesus,&mdash;any
more than if, at this time of day, it were broached
by any man now living: that thus, in so far as he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>
seen to have <i>added</i> anything to the religion of Jesus,
he is seen to set himself <i>above</i> it and <i>against</i> it:
that, therefore, if this be true, it rests with every
professor of the religion of Jesus, to settle with himself,
to which of the two religions, that of Jesus and
that of Paul, he will adhere: and, accordingly, either
to say, <i>Not Jesus but Paul</i>,&mdash;or, in the words of the
title to this work, <i>Not Paul but Jesus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

be liable to have place on the part of the reader,&mdash;and therewith,
the idea of inconsistency, as having place here and there in
the work,&mdash;the following indication may be found to have its use.
</p>
<p>
A cloud of uncertainty, to the length of one or two years, hangs
over the duration of the period embraced by this work: namely,
that between the point of time at which the conversion of Paul
is stated to have taken place, and the point of time at which the
history, intituled The Acts of the Apostles, as therein declared,
concludes:&mdash;a point of time, posterior by two years to that of his
arrival at Rome.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> For making the requisite separation, between the two religions
of Jesus and the religion of Paul,&mdash;an instrument, alike commodious
and unexceptionable, has&mdash;for these many years, though, assuredly,
not with any such view,&mdash;been presented to all hands, by
Doctor <i>Gastrell</i>, an English and Church of England Bishop: namely,
in a well-known work, intituled <i>The Christian Institutes</i>: date of
the 14th Edition, 1808. It is composed of a collection of points
of faith and morality, and under each are quoted the several texts,
in the New Testament, which are regarded by the author as affording
grounds for the positions indicated. If then, anywhere, in
his composition of the ground, passages, one or more, from this or
that Epistle of Paul, are employed,&mdash;unaccompanied with any passage,
extracted from any of the four Gospels,&mdash;the reader may,
without much danger of error, venture to conclude, that it is to
the religion of Paul alone, that the point of doctrine thus supported
appertains, and not to the religion of Jesus. As to any of the Epistles,
which bear the name of any of the real Apostles of Jesus,&mdash;a
corresponding question may perhaps be here suggesting itself. But,
with regard to the design of the present work, scarcely will they
be found relevant. For, when compared with the sayings of Jesus
as repeated in the four Gospels, scarcely will they be found exhibiting
any additional points of doctrine: never, pregnant with any
of those dissentions, which, from the writings of Paul, have issued
in such disastrous abundance. Only lest they should be thought to
have been overlooked, is any mention here made, of those documents,
which, how much soever on other accounts entitled to regard, may,
with reference to the question between the religion of Jesus and
the religion of Paul, be, as above, and without impropriety, stated as
irrelevant.</p></div></div>

<h5>Ch. ix. 1-9.</h5>

<p>1.&mdash;But Saul, yet breathing threatening and slaughter against the
disciples of the Lord, went unto the High Priest, and asked of him
letters to Damascus unto the synagogues, that if he found any that
were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them
bound to Jerusalem. And as he journeyed, it came to pass that
he drew nigh unto Damascus: and suddenly there shone around
about him a light out of heaven: and he fell upon the earth, and
heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom
thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks:
(1) but rise, and enter into the city, and it shall be told thee what
thou must do. And the men that journeyed with him stood speechless,
hearing the voice,&mdash;but beholding no man. And Saul arose
from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw nothing;
(old version "no man") and they led him by the hand, and brought
him into Damascus. And he was three days without sight, and
did neither eat nor drink.</p>


<h4>II. PAUL'S FIRST PERSONAL ACCOUNT.</h4>

<h5>As per Acts xxii. 3-11.</h5>

<p>I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this
city, at the feet of Gamaliel, instructed according to the strict manner
of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God, even as ye all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span>
are this day: and I persecuted this Way unto the death, binding
and delivering into prisons both men and women. As also the
High Priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders:
from whom also I received letters unto the brethren; and journeyed
to Damascus, to bring them also which were there unto Jerusalem
in bonds, for to be punished. And it came to pass, that, as I made
my journey, and drew nigh unto Damascus, about noon, suddenly
there shown from heaven a great light round about me. And I
fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul,
why persecutest thou me? And I answered, Who art thou, Lord?
And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.
And they that were with me beheld in deed the light, but
they heard not the voice of him that spake to me. And I said,
What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and
go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things
which are appointed for thee to do. And when I could not see
for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that
were with me, I came into Damascus.</p>


<h4>III. PAUL'S SECOND PERSONAL ACCOUNT.</h4>

<h5>As per Acts xxvi. 9-20.</h5>

<p>I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things
contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. And this I also did
in Jerusalem: and I both shut up many of the saints in prison, having
received authority from the Chief Priests, and when they were
put to death, I gave my vote against them. And punishing them
oftentimes in all the synagogues, I strove to make them blaspheme;
and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even
unto foreign cities. Whereupon as I journeyed to Damascus with
the authority and commission of the Chief Priests, at midday, O,
king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, above the brightness
of the sun, shining round about me and them that journeyed with
me. And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice
saying unto me in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why persecutest
thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the goad. And I said,
Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou
persecutest. But arise, and stand upon thy feet: for to this end
have I appeared unto thee, to appoint thee a minister and a witness
both of thee, to appoint thee a minister and a witness both of the
things wherein thou hast seen me, and of the things wherein I will
appear unto thee; delivering thee from the people, and from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>
Gentiles, unto whom I send thee, to open their eyes, that they may
turn from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God,
that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among
them that are sanctified by faith in me. Wherefore, O king Agrippa,
I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision: but declared both
to them of Damascus first, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all
the country of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should
repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance.</p>


<h4>IV. PAUL'S ALLUSIONS.</h4>

<h5>I. As per Paul to Corinth. i. xv. 8.</h5>

<p>And last of all, as unto one born out of due time, he appeared
to me, also.</p>


<h5>II. As per Paul to Gal. i. 12, 15, 16, 17.</h5>

<p>12. For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it,
but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>15. But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me,
even from my mother's womb,</p>

<p>16. And called me through his grace, to reveal his Son in me,
that I might preach him among the Gentiles; immediately I conferred
not with flesh and blood:</p>

<p>17. Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles
before me: but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned unto
Damascus.</p>


<h4>II. VISION 2.&mdash;ANANIAS'S.</h4>

<h5><i>I. Acts Account.</i></h5>

<h5>ix. 10-16.</h5>

<p>10. Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias;
and the Lord said unto him in a vision, Ananias! And he said,
Behold, I am here, Lord. And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and
go to the street which is called <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Stright'">Straight</ins>, and inquire in the house
of Judas for one named Saul, a man of Tarsus: for behold, he
prayeth: and he hath seen a man named Ananias coming in, and
laying his hands on him, that he might receive his sight. But
Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many of this man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>
how much evil he did to thy saints at Jerusalem: and here he hath
authority from the chief priests to bind all that call upon thy
name. But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a
chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles and
kings, and the children of Israel: for I will shew him how many
things he must suffer for my name's sake.</p>


<h4>III. ANANIAS'S VISIT TO PAUL.</h4>

<h5><i>I. Acts Account.</i></h5>

<h5>ix. 17-22.</h5>

<p>And Ananias departed, and entered into the house; and laying
his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord even Jesus, who
appeared unto thee in the way which thou camest, hath sent me,
that thou mayest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy
Ghost. And straightway there fell from his eyes as it were scales,
and he received his sight; and he arose and was baptized; and
he took food and was strengthened.</p>

<p>And he was certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus.
And straightway in the synagogues he proclaimed Jesus, that he
is the Son of God. And all that heard him were amazed, and said,
Is not this he that in Jerusalem made havock of them which called
on his name? and he had come hither for this intent, that he might
bring them bound before the chief priests. But Saul increased the
more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus,
proving that this is the Christ.</p>


<h5><i>II. Paul's Account.</i></h5>

<h5>As per Acts xxii. 12-16.</h5>

<p>xxii. 12. And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law,
well reported of by all the Jews that dwelt there, came unto me,
and standing by me said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight.
And in that very hour I looked up on him. And he said, The
God of our fathers hath appointed thee to know his will, and to
see the Righteous One, and to hear a voice from his mouth. For
thou shalt be a witness for him unto all men of what thou hast
seen and heard. And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized,
and wash away thy sins, calling on his name.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[Pg 1]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Paul's Conversion.</i><a name="FNanchor_1_3" id="FNanchor_1_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_3" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>&mdash;<i>Improbability and Discordancy
of the Accounts of it.</i></h3>

<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION I.</h4>

<h5>LIST OF THESE ACCOUNTS, WITH PRELIMINARY
OBSERVATIONS.</h5>

<h5>(<i>See</i> <span class="smcap">Table I.</span>, <i>in which they are confronted</i>.)</h5>

<p>In one single work, and that alone, is comprised the
whole of the information, in which, in relation to
this momentous occurrence, any particulars are at
this time of day to be found. This is that historical
work, which in our edition of the Bible, has for its
title <i>The Acts of the Apostles</i>; for shortness, let us
say <i>The Acts</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>
<p>Of this same occurrence, in this one short work
no fewer than three separate accounts are visible;
one, in which the story is related by the historian in
his own person; two others, in each of which Paul is
introduced as giving his own account of it. Of these
three accounts, no two will be found agreeing with
each other. By the historian, Paul when introduced
as speaking in his own person, is represented as
contradicting not only the historian's account, but
his own account. On each occasion, it should seem,
Paul's account is adapted to the occasion. On the
first occasion, the historian's account was not exactly
adapted to that same first occasion. By the historian's
ingenuity, Paul is accordingly represented
as giving on that same occasion another and better-adapted
account. On the second occasion, neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
was the historian's account nor Paul's own account,
as given on the former occasion, found suitable to
this fresh occasion; on this same fresh occasion, a
suitable amendment is accordingly framed.</p>

<p>Here, at the very outset of the inquiry, the distance
of time between the point of time on which the occurrence
is supposed to have taken place, and the
time at which the historian's account of it was
penned, are circumstances that present a claim to
notice.</p>

<p>The year 35 after the birth of Christ is the year
which, according to the received accounts, is assigned
to the occurrence. According to these same accounts,
the year 63 is the date given to the last occurrence
mentioned by the historian, Acts 28: after which
occurrence, two years are stated by him as having
elapsed, at the time at which the history closes. Here
then is an interval of about 30 years, between the
time at which the occurrence is stated to have happened,
and the time at which these three mutually
contradictory accounts of it were framed.</p>

<p>In regard to this radical occurrence in particular,
namely Paul's conversion,&mdash;for the foundation of
this his report, what evidence was it that the reporter
had, or could have had in his possession, or at
his command? One answer may serve for all; the
accounts given of the matter by Paul himself.</p>

<p>With Paul, then, what were this same reporter's
means and mode of intercourse? In the year 59, and
not before, (such is the inference from his own
words) did it fall to his lot to be taken into the train
of this self-denominated Apostle. Then it is, that
for the first time, in the several accounts given by
him of Paul's migrations from place to place, the
pronouns <i>us</i>, Acts 20:5, and <i>we</i> make their appearance.
From 34 to 59 years are 25. At the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
this interval came the earliest opportunity, which,
for anything that appears, he could have had of
hearing from his master's own mouth, whatsoever
account, if any, it may have been the pleasure of
that same master to give, of an occurrence, in relation
to which there existed not among men any
other percipient witness.</p>

<p>Having accompanied his master during the whole
of his progress from Jerusalem, the historian speaks
of himself as being still in his train on his arrival
at Rome. Acts xxviii. 16, "And when we came to
Rome," &amp;c. It is not precisely stated, nor can it
very determinately be inferred, whether at the point
of time at which the history closes, the historian was
still at that capital; the negative supposition presents
itself as the most probable. Posterior to the
closing of the real action of the history, the penning
of it will naturally be to be placed.</p>

<p>"Paul, says the Acts xxviii. 30, dwelt two whole
years in his own hired house, and received all that
came in unto him," &amp;c. When this last verse but
one of the history was penning, had the historian
been living with Paul, he would naturally have given
us to understand as much; instead of <i>dwelt</i>, he
would have said <i>has been dwelling</i>.</p>

<p>By the tokens of carelessness afforded by the omission
of so many particulars, which in every work of
an historical nature the reader will naturally expect
to see specified; such as the name of the historian,
the particulars, occasion and manner of his
being taken into the company of the illustrious missionary,
and the time of that event;&mdash;by these tokens,
two inferences, how different soever their tendency,
seem at once to be suggested. One is, the genuineness
of the narrative. A writer, who was conscious
that he was not the man he was thus representing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
himself to be, viz. the companion of the missionary,
would hardly have slid in, in so careless a manner,
the mention of so material a circumstance. The
other is, the slenderness of the author's qualification
for the task thus executed by him; the lowness of
his station in the scale of trustworthiness, and consequently
the smallness of the probative force, with
which a mass of evidence thus circumstanced can
reasonably be considered as operating, in support of
any alleged matter of fact, which, (either by the
extraordinariness of its nature, or the temptation
which the circumstances of the case afforded for
entire fiction or misrepresentation), presents itself
as exposed to doubt or controversy.</p>

<p>A supernatural conversion, and the receipt of a
supernatural commission for the delivery of a fresh
body of doctrine; such are the two events, which,
though in their nature so perfectly distinguishable,
were according to this narrative combined in one:&mdash;the
conversion from an unbelieving, cruel, and destructive
persecutor of the new fellowship, into a
most zealous supporter and coadjutor: the body of
doctrine such as if it amounted to anything, could
not but have been&mdash;what the person in question declared
it to be&mdash;a supplement to the religion taught
by Jesus while in the flesh;&mdash;a supplement, containing
matter never revealed to, and consequently
never taught by, his Apostles.</p>

<p>Now then, of all these supernatural occurrences,
which, by the nameless historiographer, are related
to have happened to Paul, if anything had really
happened to him&mdash;on this supposition, (so many as
were the different sets of disciples of his, inhabitants
of so many mutually distant provinces, no fewer than
eight in number); is it in the nature of the case,
that in no one instance, in any of his numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Epistles, he should have felt the necessity of stating
and accordingly have stated, to any of these his
disciples, the circumstances attending the event of
his conversion&mdash;an event on which alone all his professions
were founded? circumstances to which, as
stated in his historian's narrative, could not from
their nature have been known to any human being
other than himself?</p>

<p>Yet, in no one of all his Epistles, to any one of
these his disciples, of any such particular, either in
the way of direct assertion, or in the way of allusion,
is any trace to be found. Of <i>revelation</i>, yes: of
<i>revelation</i>&mdash;this one most momentous indeed, but at
the same time most mysterious and uninstructive
word, repetitions we have in abundance. But of the
time and manner of the alleged communication, or
of the matter communicated, nothing is anywhere
said.</p>

<p>In these considerations may be seen a part, though
but a part, of those, on which, in due season, will
be seen grounded the inference,&mdash;that at no time,
in all the personal conferences he had with the Apostles,
was any such story told by Paul, as is related
by the author of the Acts.</p>

<p>On the supposition that the narrative, such as it
is, is genuine,&mdash;taking it as a whole, a very important
source of division, from which it will require
to be divided in idea into two parts or periods, here
presents itself. Period the first, containing the portion
of time <i>anterior</i> to the historian's admission
into the train of the supposed Apostle: Period the
second, containing the portion of time <i>posterior</i> to
that event: this latter portion continuing, as far as
appears, to the time at which the history closes.</p>

<p>In this latest and last-mentioned period are comprised
all the several facts, or supposed facts, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
relation to which any grounds appear for the supposition
that the historian was, in his own person, a
percipient witness.</p>

<p>In relation to all the several facts, or supposed
facts, anterior to this period,&mdash;the best evidence,
which, for anything that appears, ever came within
his reach, was composed of such statements as, in
the course of his service, it may have been the pleasure
of the master to make to, or in the hearing of,
this his attendant. Whatsoever may be the grounds
of suspicion that may be found attaching themselves
to evidence passing through such a channel, or issuing
from such a source; other evidence will, if taken
in the lump, present itself as being in comparison
much less trustworthy. All other evidence consists
of statements, coming from we know not whom, at
we know not what times, on we know not what occasion,
each of them with we know not how many reporting
witnesses, one after and from another,
through so many different and successive channels,
between the percipient witness or witnesses, and the
last reporting witness or witnesses, from whom the
historian received the statement in the way of
personal intercourse.</p>

<p>The period of <i>rumour</i>, and the period of <i>observation</i>&mdash;By
these two appellations it should seem, may
the two periods be not altogether unaptly or uninstructively
distinguished.</p>

<p>With reference to the period of rumour,&mdash;whether,
it was from Paul's own statement, or from a source
still more exposed to suspicion, that the historian's
conception was derived,&mdash;one consideration presents
itself, as requisite to be kept in mind. This is, With
what facility, especially in that age, upon an occurrence
in itself true, and including nothing that lies
without the ordinary course of nature,&mdash;a circumstance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
out of the course of nature, giving to the
whole a supernatural, and to use the ordinary word
a miraculous, character, may, in and by the narrative,
have been superinduced.<a name="FNanchor_2_4" id="FNanchor_2_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_4" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Fact, for instance,
as it <i>really</i> was&mdash;at the word of command, (suppose)
a man, having the appearance of a cripple, stands up
erect and walks: untrue circumstances, one or both
superinduced by <i>rumour</i>&mdash;the man had been so from
his birth; from his birth down to that same time he
had been an inhabitant of that same place.</p>

<p>In the chapter on Paul's supposable miracles,
about a dozen occurrences of this description will be
found. On each one of these several occasions, the
propriety of bearing in mind the above-mentioned
consideration, will, it is believed, not appear open
to dispute, whatsoever on each several occasion may
be the application made of it.</p>

<hr class="r5" />
<p>On comparing the three accounts of Vision 1st, the
particulars will be found referable to twelve heads.
Under no more than two of the twelve, will the conformity
among them be found entire.</p>

<p>Where disconformity has place it may be clear or
not clear of contradiction. Clear it may be of contradiction,
when it consists either of mere deficiency
or mere redundancy, or of both: deficiency or redundancy,
according as it is this or that account, which,
on the occasion of the comparison, is taken for the
standard.</p>

<p>On the occasion in question, such is the importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
of the occurrence, that the proper standard of reference
and comparison is that which is most ample:
that which, if not strictly speaking complete, wants
the least of being so. On the part of the historian,
speaking in his own person, omission is in such a
case without excuse.</p>

<p>Not so, necessarily, in the case of a person whom
the historian speaks of as giving that person's own
account of that same occurrence. What may be is,
that in the nature of the occasion in which the person
is represented as speaking of it, there is so much of
suddenness, by reason of impending danger, or
urgent pressure, that, of the quantity of time necessary
for complete utterance, and even of that necessary
for complete and correct recollection, more or
less was wanting.</p>

<p>On the occasion of that account of the matter,
which is the first of the two on which the historian
represents Paul as giving an account of this momentous
occurrence,&mdash;this justification for want of completeness,
or this excuse for want of correctness,
might naturally enough have place. For it was while
pleading for his life at Jerusalem, before a mixed
multitude, no inconsiderable part of which were endeavouring
at the destruction of it, that Paul is represented
as delivering this first of his two accounts:&mdash;call
that <i>the supposed unstudied or unpremeditated
account</i>.</p>

<p>Not so, on the occasion on which he is represented
as delivering the second of these same two accounts.
On this occasion, it is true, he is represented as pleading
in his defence. But it is pleading in and before
a regularly constituted judiciary, and after time for
preparation in much greater abundance than he could
have wished:&mdash;call this <i>the supposed studied or premeditated
account</i>.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>In this view, the proper standard of comparison
can not be dubious. The historian being himself, in
all three accounts, the immediately reporting witness,
and having had his own time for the forming of
them all,&mdash;that which he gives in his own person, and
which therefore naturally occupies the first place,
should, in respect of both qualities, as well as in that
of clearness, have been, (and, setting aside deceptious
design, naturally would have been), as perfect as it
was in his power to make it. To the others alone
could any excuse be afforded, in respect of any one
of those requisites, by any circumstance peculiar to
the respective cases.</p>

<p>What is above being observed&mdash;Of the ten following
instances of disconformity, seven will be found
to be cases of simple deficiency, three of contradiction.</p>

<p>In those which are cases of simple deficiency, it
will be seen to have urgency for its justification or
excuse; for the others there appears no justification
or excuse.<a name="FNanchor_3_5" id="FNanchor_3_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_5" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Of the twelve distinguishable heads in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
question, under two alone, viz. that of <i>place</i> and that
of <i>time</i>, will the conformity be found complete. <i>Place</i>,
a spot near to Damascus, in the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'read'">road</ins> leading from
Jerusalem to Damascus: <i>Time</i>, meaning time of <i>day</i>,&mdash;about
noon. But, in the quality of trustworthiness
deficient as all three accounts will presently be shown
to be, it will be seen how little is contributed, by conformity
as to the mere circumstances of time and
place.</p>

<p>Now then let us see the subjects, in relation to
which a want of conformity is observable. To save
words, the shortest form of description possible will
throughout be employed.</p>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>1. <i>Light seen.</i> Between Acts account and Paul's
1st or supposed unstudied account, no disconformity
worth remarking. In Acts it is a "<i>light</i>," in Paul 1st
a "<i>great light</i>";<a name="FNanchor_4_6" id="FNanchor_4_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_6" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> in both it is about midday. But
in Paul's 2d or supposed studied account, it is above
the brightness of the sun at that time of the day.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a><br /><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>
<p>In Acts the passage is simply narrative: in Paul's
1st, the urgency of the occasion left no room for
flowers. But in Paul's 2d, time being abundant,
flowers were to be collected, and this is one of them.
In the ordinary course of nature there exists not
upon earth any light equal in brightness to that of
the sun; especially the sun at midday, and in such a
latitude. Supposing the light in question ever so
much greater than the midday sun, neither Paul
nor this his historian could, without a miracle on
purpose, have had any means of knowing as much.
For a miracle for such a purpose, the existence of
any effectual demand does not seem probable. For
the purpose mentioned,&mdash;namely the bereaving of
the power of vision every open eye that should direct
itself towards it,&mdash;to wit, so long as that same direction
should continue,&mdash;the ordinary light of the sun
would have been quite sufficient. At the time and
place in question, whatever they may have been, suppose
it true that, though midday was the time, the
atmosphere was cloudy, and in such sort cloudy, that
without something done for the purpose, a light productive
of such effects could not have been produced.
Still, for this purpose, a specially created body of
light different from that of the sun, and exceeding
it in intensity, could not be needful. The removal
of a single cloud would have been amply sufficient:&mdash;a
single cloud, and that a very small one.</p>

<p>But if the light was really a light created for the
purpose, and brighter than that of the sun; of circumstances
so important, mention should not have
been omitted in the standard narrative.</p>

<p>Here then is either a deficiency in the standard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
narrative,&mdash;and this deficiency, as already observed,
an inexcusable one,&mdash;or a redundancy in the subsequent
account: a redundancy, the cause of which
seems sufficiently obvious: a redundancy&mdash;in that
account which, being premeditated on the part of
the historian, is given by him as being premeditated
on the part of the speaker, whom he represents as
delivering it: a redundancy,&mdash;and that in a word a
falsehood: a falsehood, and for what purpose?&mdash;for
deception: the hero represented by his historian as
using endeavours to deceive.</p>

<p>2. <i>Dialogue.</i> Per Acts, the Dialogue contained
five speeches: to wit, 1. The voice's speech; 2. Paul's;
3. The Lord's, whose voice, Paul and his historiographer<a name="FNanchor_5_7" id="FNanchor_5_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_7" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>,
from what experience is not said, knew
the voice to be; 4. Paul's; 5. The Lord's. In Paul 1st,
speeches the same in number, order, and, save in
one phrase about kicking against the pricks, nearly
so in terms. But in Paul 2d, the number of the
speeches is no more than three: and, as will be seen
below, of the last the import is widely different from
that of any of those reported in the other two accounts.</p>

<p>3. <i>Falling to the ground.</i> Per Acts and Paul 1st,
by Paul alone was this prostration experienced. Per
Paul 2d, by his unnumbered companions, by the
whole company of them, as well as by himself. Deficiency
here on the part of the proper standard; so,
in the case of the unstudied speech. In the studied
speech it is supplied.</p>

<p>4. <i>Language of the voice.</i> Per Acts and Paul 1st,
of the language nothing is said. Deficiency, as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the case last mentioned; to wit, in the regular history,
and in the unstudied speech. In the studied
speech it is supplied. Stage effect greater. Agrippa,
to whom it was more particularly addressed, being,
under the Roman viceroy, a sort of king of the Jews,&mdash;what
seems to have occurred to the historian is&mdash;that
it might be a sort of gratification to him to be
informed, that his own language, the Hebrew, was
the language which, on this occasion, was employed
by that voice, which by Paul, by whom it had never
been heard before, was immediately understood to
be the Lord's; <i>i.e.</i> Jesus's; <i>i.e.</i> God's. The character,
in which Paul was on this occasion brought
by his historiographer on the stage, being that of a
consummate orator, furnished with all his graces,&mdash;this
compliment was among the rest put into his
mouth. Moreover, by Jesus no language, for aught
that appears, but the Hebrew, having been ever
spoken, hence the account became the more consistent
or credible.</p>

<p>5. <i>Kicking against the pricks.</i><a name="FNanchor_6_8" id="FNanchor_6_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_8" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> "Hard for
thee to kick against the pricks." Per Acts, this
proverbial expression is employed by the voice, as
soon as it turns out to have been the Lord's. In the
supposed and hasty unstudied speech, it is dropped.
This is natural enough. In Paul 2d&mdash;in that studied
speech, it is employed: it stands there among the
flowers.</p>

<p>6. <i>The Lord's Commands.</i> Commands delivered
to Paul by the Lord. Under this head there is a
disastrous difference; a sad contradiction. Per Acts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the command is for Paul to go into Damascus: there
it stops. Follows immediately an article of information,
which is, that at that time and place there is
no information for him; but that, sooner or later,
some will be ready for him. After he has arrived at
Damascus, it shall there, by somebody or other, be
told him, it is said, what he is to do. So likewise in
Paul 1st, in the unstudied speech, he is, in like manner,
to learn not merely what he is to do, but everything
that he is to do. Lastly comes, Paul 2d, the
studied speech. By the time the historian had arrived
at this point in his history, he had forgotten
that, according to his own account of the matter, no
information at all had, during the road scene, been
given to Paul by the Lord's voice; by that voice
which was so well known to be the Lord's. That
the supposed studied speech, by the charms of which
the favour of the King was so happily gained, might
be the more impressive,&mdash;he makes his orator, in
direct contradiction to the account which, on the
former occasion, had by him (the historian) been
given, enter, on the very spot, into all the details
of the Lord's commands.</p>

<p>When the time had come for composing this supposed
studied speech,&mdash;the historian had, it should
seem, forgot Ananias's vision, that subsidiary vision,
which we shall come to presently, containing a further
promise of the Lord's commands and instructions;
and which, after all, unless it is by this studied
speech that they are to be regarded as given, are
not given by him anywhere.</p>

<p>7. <i>Paul's companions&mdash;their posture.</i> Per Acts,
though he fell, they stood it out. Per Paul 1st, not
said whether they fell or stood it out. Per Paul 2d,
they fell. The supposed studied oratorical account
is here in full contradiction with the historical one.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>8. <i>Paul's companions&mdash;their hearing or not hearing.</i>
Per Acts, they not only saw the light, but heard
the voice. Per Paul 1st, they did NOT hear the voice.
In the supposed hasty and unstudied speech is the
oratorical account made to contradict the historical
one. In this particular, which of the accounts was
true? If the historical, the haste must, in the oratorical,
be the apology, not only for the incompleteness
but for the incorrectness. In Paul 2d, nothing
is said about their hearing or not hearing.</p>

<p>Supposing the story in any of the accounts to have
had any truth in it, there was a middle case, fully as
possible and natural as either of these extreme and
mutually contradictory ones. It may have been, that
while some stood their ground, others fell. And the
greater the numbers, the greater the probability of
this middle case. But as to their number, all is
darkness.</p>

<p>9. <i>Paul's companions&mdash;if they heard, what it was
they heard.</i> If they heard anything, they heard, as
far as appears, whatever Paul himself heard. Per
Acts, it is after the order given to Paul to go on
to Damascus,&mdash;with the promise thereupon, that
there and then, and not before, he should receive
the information he should receive; it is after the
statement made of his hearing all this from the voice,
that the further statement comes, declaring that it
was by Paul's companions also that this same voice
was heard. But this same voice was, it is said, the
Lord's voice. That when the voice had answered to
the name by which Paul called it, to wit, the name
of Lord, it stopt there, so far as concerned Paul's
companions;&mdash;and that it reserved what followed, to
wit, the above-mentioned order with the promise, for
Paul's single ear; true it is, this may be <i>imagined</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
as well as anything else: but at any rate it is not
<i>said</i>.</p>

<p>If Paul 2d&mdash;the studied oratorical account&mdash;is to
be believed, all the information for the communication
of which this miracle was performed was, as
will be seen, communicated here upon the road: viz.
immediately after the voice had been called by him
<i>Lord</i>. But, if this was the case, and, as above, Paul's
companions heard all that he heard,&mdash;then so it is,
that the revelation was made as well to them as to
him;&mdash;this revelation, upon the strength of which we
shall see him setting himself up above all the Apostles;
himself and that Gospel of his own, which he
says was his own, and none of theirs. Now then&mdash;these
companions&mdash;was it upon the same errand as
his that they went, to wit, the bringing in bonds to
Jerusalem all the Damascus Christians? If so, or
if on any other account they were any of them in a
condition to need conversion,&mdash;they were converted
as well as he; or else, so far as concerned them, the
miracle was thrown away. Companions as they were
of his, were they or were they not respectively attendants
of his? attendants going under his orders,
and on the same errand? Unless, by the Jerusalem
rulers, on the part of the Damascus rulers, both will
and power were depended upon, as adequate to the
task of apprehending the followers of Jesus and
sending them bound to Jerusalem, such these companions
ought to have been, every one of them&mdash;supposing
always on the part of this about-to-be
Apostle an ordinary prudence: that sort and degree
of prudence with which no ordinary police-officer is
unprovided. Some persons under his orders he must
have had, or he could never have been sent on so
extensively and strongly coercive an errand.</p>

<p>These companions, if, on this occasion, any such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
or any other companions he had, had each of them a
name. To this vision, such as it was, they being each
of them respectively, as well as himself, whether in
the way of sight and hearing both, or in the way of
sight alone, percipient witnesses, their names, in the
character of so many percipient witnesses, ready
upon every proper occasion to answer in the character
of <i>reporting</i> witnesses, would have been of no
small use: of use, were it only for the giving to this
story a little more substance than it has in the form
we see it in.</p>

<p>As to Ananias&mdash;the supposed principal actor in
the scene next to Paul&mdash;for him, indeed, supposing
any such person to have existed, a name, it is seen,
was found. But, with a view to any purpose of
evidence, how little that name amounted to, will be
seen likewise.</p>

<p>In this vision of Paul's, as it is called,&mdash;was any
person seen, or anything but light&mdash;light at midday?
No; positively not any person, nor as far as appears,
the light excepted, anything whatsoever. Per Acts,
chap. ix:8, when "his eyes were opened,"&mdash;so it is
expressly said,&mdash;"he saw no man." This was after
he had fallen to the earth; for it was after he arose
from the earth. But, it was before he fell to the
earth, and thereupon heard the voice, that, according
to this same account, he saw the extra light&mdash;the
light created for the purpose: and, forasmuch as at
the conclusion of the dialogue with the five speeches
in it&mdash;forasmuch as at the conclusion of it, such was
the effect produced upon him by the light, as to render
him at that time stone-blind, requiring to be
led by the hand, it could not from the first have been
anything less effective. Per Acts, in this state he
continues all the way as far as Damascus, and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
three days after his arrival there. So likewise in
the supposed unstudied speech, Paul 1st. But in
the studied speech, Paul 2d, there is no blindness; the
blindness is either forgotten or discarded.</p>

<p>But the curious circumstance is, his being led by
the hand&mdash;all the way to Damascus led by the hand:&mdash;led
by the hand by these same companions. Now
these same companions, how was it that they were
able to lead him by the hand? All that he saw was
the light, and by that light he was blinded. But all
that he saw they saw: this same light they saw as
well as he. This same light, then, by which he was
blinded&mdash;were they not blinded likewise by it? Was
it a privilege&mdash;a privilege reserved for a chosen
favourite&mdash;a privilege which it cost a miracle to produce&mdash;the
being blinded when nobody else was
blinded?</p>

<p>Blinded then as they were, how came he to be led
by them, any more than they by him? Can the blind
lead the blind? Let Jesus answer. Shall they not
both fall into the ditch?</p>

<p>Oh! but (says somebody) it is only in Paul 1st,&mdash;in
Paul's supposed unstudied speech, that the historian
makes them see the light that Paul saw. Answer.
True: but neither in his own person does he say the
contrary. As to their seeing, all he says is, that <i>they</i>
saw no man, "hearing a voice but seeing no man."
(ver. 7.) But by the same account, (ver. 8.) "When
<i>his</i> eyes were opened, he saw no man;" so that,
though in what he says in his own person the historian
does not mention this which he mentions,
speaking in Paul's person,&mdash;yet he does not contradict
it.</p>

<p>10. <i>Paul's companions. What part, if any, took
they in the conversation?</i> Per Acts, they stood
speechless: and it is after the dialogue has been reported,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
that this is stated. In the unstudied speech,
nothing is said about their speech. In the studied
speech, with reference to them, no mention is made
of speech; any more than of sight or hearing.</p>

<p>But, forasmuch as, according to Acts, whatever
Paul saw and heard, they saw and heard likewise;
how happened it, that by no one of them, so much
as a word, on an occasion so interesting to all, was
said&mdash;or a question put? To be sure it was to Paul
alone, that by the voice, whosever it was, any address
was made. It was his concern:&mdash;his alone, and none
of theirs.</p>

<p>So, indeed, some might think; but, others in their
situation, quite as naturally might think otherwise.
Sooner or later, at any rate, they would recover
whatever it was they lost: sight, if sight; speech, if
speech. Whenever recovered, speech would thereupon
range with but the greater freedom, for the
restraint which, for a time, had been put upon it:&mdash;range
over the whole business, including whatever
secrets Paul had been put in possession of:&mdash;the
commission, the sweeping and incarcerating commission
he had been intrusted with by the rulers, and
the unperformed promise that had been made to him
by the voice, which being at midday, accompanied
by an extraordinary light, was of course the Lord's
voice. These things would naturally, by these his
companions, have been converted from secrets into
town-talk.</p>

<p>Nay but (says somebody) though it <i>is</i> said he saw
no <i>man</i>, it is <i>not</i> said, he saw not the Lord: and elsewhere
he may be seen saying&mdash;saying in the most
positive terms, that he did see the Lord<a name="FNanchor_7_9" id="FNanchor_7_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_9" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
if he did see the Lord anywhere, why not here as
well as anywhere else?</p>

<p>"<i>Saw no man.</i>" Yes: so says the English version.
But the original is more comprehensive:&mdash;Saw no
person, says the original: that is, to speak literally,
saw no one of the masculine gender. No one what?
No one person of this gender: this is what the word
means, if it means anything. No person; and therefore
no Lord: no God; if so it be that, when applied
to denote God, the word person means God, or as
some say, a part of God.</p>

<p>Note, likewise,&mdash;that, when the companions are
spoken of,&mdash;both in the translation and in the original,
the object to which the negative is applied is
expressed by the same word as when he, Paul, is
spoken of.</p>

<h4>SECTION 3.</h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">Vision II.&mdash;Ananias's.</span></h5>

<h5><span class="smcap">Topic 1.</span>&mdash;<i>Ananias's Description.</i></h5>

<p>Of the vision itself there being but one account, by
this singleness discordancy is saved.</p>

<p>But, of the description belonging to Ananias there
are two accounts. One the historical, as before: the
other, the unpremeditated oratorical account supposed
to be given by Paul in the first of his two
supposed speeches, as above; and, room being thus
given for discordancy,&mdash;discordancy, as of course,
enters&mdash;or at any rate a strong suspicion of it.</p>

<p>Per Acts, Ananias is a disciple: a disciple, to wit,
a Christian; a disciple immediately of Jesus or his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Apostles: for, such is the signification attached to
the word <i>disciple</i> in the Acts: such he would on this
occasion be of course understood to be; for, otherwise
the word would be uncharacteristic and insignificant.</p>

<p>Materially different is the description supposed to
have been given of this same Ananias by Paul in that
same supposed unpremeditated speech; so different
as to be not without effort, if by any effort, reconcilable
with it.</p>

<p>He is now a disciple of Jesus and the Apostles; of
that Jesus, by whom the law, <i>i.e.</i> the Mosaic law, was
after such repeated exposure of its inaptitude, pronounced
obsolete. He is now not only spoken of as
being, notwithstanding this conversion, a devout man
according to that same law; but, moreover, as having
a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there, to
wit, at Damascus. Of the Jews? Yes; of "<i>all</i>" the
Jews.</p>

<p>If, notwithstanding his conversion to a religion by
which that of the Jews was slighted and declared to
be superseded, he was still so happy as to be the
subject of this good <i>report</i>, which is as much as to
say&mdash;of a correspondently unanimous good opinion;
this, it would seem, would have been the man to
preach to them that religion: especially if that part
of the story were true, according to which he was
distinguished by the same supernatural sort of communication;
this man, who was already a Christian,
this man, and not Paul, who of all opposers of Christianity
had been the most fierce and the most mischievous,
would naturally have been the man to
receive the supernatural commission. Supposing his
vision real, and the reports of it true, no difficulty,
rationally speaking, could he have found in obtaining
credence for it at the hands of the Apostles: those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Apostles, at whose hands, from first to last it will
be seen, never was it the lot of Paul, with <i>his</i> vision
or visions, to obtain credence.</p>

<p>The audience, before which this speech was supposed
to be delivered, of whom was it composed?
With the exception of a few Romans, to whom it
was probably unintelligible unless by accident, altogether
of Jews; and these&mdash;no one can say in what
proportion, probably in by much the largest, Jews
not christianized. Hence then the sort of character,
which the occasion and the purpose required should
be given, to this supposed miraculously formed acquaintance
of the person who, upon the strength of
this acquaintance, was to be numbered among the
Apostles.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Topic 2.</span>&mdash;<i>Mode of Conversation.</i></h5>

<p>By this vision is produced a dialogue. Interlocutors,
the Lord and Ananias. In the course of the
dialogue, speeches five: whereof, by the Lord, three;
the other two by Ananias.</p>

<p>In and by the first pair of speeches the Lord calls
the man by his name: the man answers, Behold,
says he, I am here, Lord. In the English translation,
to atone for the too great conciseness of the Greek
original, the words "<i>am here</i>" are not improperly
interpolated. Giving to this supposed supernatural
intercourse what seemed to him a natural cast&mdash;a
cast suited to the occasion&mdash;seems to have been the
object of the historian in the composition of this
dialogue. But, upon so supernatural a body, a natural
colouring, at any rate a colouring such as this,
does not seem to fit quite so completely as might
have been wished. On the road, when the voice,&mdash;which
turned out to be that of the Lord, that is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
being interpreted, Jesus's,&mdash;addressed itself to Paul,
this being the first intercourse, there was a necessity
for its declaring itself, for its declaring whose it
was; and the declaration was made accordingly.
Here, on the other hand, no sooner does Ananias
hear himself called by his name, than he knows who
the person is by whom he is thus addressed. Taken
as it stands, an answer thus prompt includes the supposition
of an already established intercourse. Such
intercourse supposed&mdash;in what way on former occasions
had it been carried on? Laying such former
occasion out of the question&mdash;in what way is it supposed
to be carried on on the occasion here in question?
On the occasion of his visit to Paul,&mdash;the
Lord, to whomsoever he may have been audible, had
never, from first to last, as we have seen, been visible.
On the occasion of this visit of his to Ananias&mdash;was
the Lord audible only, or visible only, or both
audible and visible? If both audible and visible, or
even if only visible,&mdash;the mode of revelation was
more favourable to this secondary and virtually unknown
personage, than to the principal one.</p>

<p>Between mortal and mortal, when it is the desire
of one man to have personal communication with
another whom he supposes to be within hearing, but
who is either not in his sight or not looking towards
him,&mdash;he calls to him by his name; and in token of
his having heard, the other answers. From man to
man, such information is really necessary; for&mdash;that
the requisite attention has place where it is his desire
that it should have place, the human interlocutor has
no other means of knowing. Not considering, that
the person to whom the information is supposed to
be conveyed is a sort of person to whom no such
information could be necessary, the historian represents
his Ananias as giving to the Lord, as if to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
mere mortal, information of his presence. Behold,
Lord! I am here.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Topic 3.</span>&mdash;<i>Lord's Commands and Information: Want of particularization
a disprobative Circumstance.</i></h5>

<p>The conversation being thus begun, the interlocutors
proceed to business. In speech the 3d, Lord
delivers to Ananias, the devout Jew, a command, and
thereupon a piece of information. The command is&mdash;to
repair to a place therein described, and find out
Paul: the information is&mdash;that at the time then
present Paul is praying; and that, at an anterior
point of time not designated, he had seen a vision.</p>

<p>In the command, the designation of the place
wears, upon the face of it, the appearance of that
sort and degree of particularity, the exaction of
which is, in these days, in which genuine visions are
never exemplified, matter of course, on every occasion
on which it is the real intention, of those on
whom it depends, that through the medium of personal
testimony the truth should be extracted. On
every such occasion, the object in question, whether
it be an event or a quiescent state of things, is endeavoured
to be individualized: and, for the production
of this effect, the individual portion of space,
and the individual portion of time, are endeavoured
to be brought to view together.</p>

<p>On the occasion here in question, towards the individualization
of the portion of space some approach
is made: the town being foreknown, to wit,
Damascus, the <i>street</i> is particularized; it is the
street called <i>Straight</i>: as in Westminster we have
<i>Long-ditch</i>, and in London <i>Crooked-lane</i>. Moreover,
the <i>house</i> is particularized; it is the house of Judas.
To this Judas had any one of those marks of distinction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
been added, which in that age and nation
we find to have been common,&mdash;as in the instance
of the too notorious Judas the Iscariot, <i>i.e.</i>, the inhabitant
of Iscara, and in that of Judas Barsabas,
<i>i.e.</i>, the son of Sabas, or, as we should say, Sabasson,
not long after mentioned, Acts 25:22,&mdash;it would
have been something. But, destitute of such limitative
adjunct, <i>Judas</i> of itself was nothing. In that
age and country, even without reckoning notorious
traitors, there was never any want of Judases. Not
inferior in plenty were Ananiases: in the Acts we
have three of them;&mdash;this private inhabitant of Damascus:
the High Priest, whose seat was at Jerusalem;
and the husband of Sapphira: and in Josephus
they vie in abundance with the Johns and Jesuses.</p>

<p>But, on the occasion in question, and to the purpose
in question, though a distinctive adjunct as
above would have done something, it would have
done very little. In the field of time,&mdash;seven-and-twenty
years at least, and we know not how much
more, according to the received chronology, was the
distance between the event in question, and the report
given of it in this history. Neither in Damascus
nor yet in Jerusalem was any such thing as a
newspaper,&mdash;not even an enslaved newspaper, in
existence; no, nor yet so much as a printing-press,&mdash;not
even an enslaved printing-press. For writing,
the materials were expensive; and handwriting was
the only mode of copying. Publication was not, as
under the printing-press, promiscuous: unless by
accident, for an indefinite length of time, into no
other hand did any copy find its way, other than
those of the author's confidential friends, or friends
separated from the author by a greater or less number
of removes, as it might happen; but all of them
linked to one another by the bonds of amity, and
unity of principle and practice.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>In such a capital as Damascus, Straight Street
might have been as long as Oxford Street; and,
unless the style of building in those earlier days had
much more of convenience and luxury in it than in
these latter days, was much more crowded. Conceive
a man at this time of day, going to Oxford
Street with the intention of finding the house, in
which, thirty years ago, a man of the name of Brown
or Smith had his residence,&mdash;to wit, on some indeterminate
day, of the number of those included within
the space of an indeterminate number of years; and
this, for the purpose of ascertaining whether, on
this indeterminate day, and by this Smith or this
Brown, a vision, not seen by anybody else, had been
seen. Suppose a man in Rome set out on such an
errand&mdash;and then say what would be the probable
result of it.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Topic 4.</span>&mdash;<i>Vision reported to Ananias by the Lord as having
been seen by Paul.</i></h5>

<p>Of the report then given of this anterior vision, the
character is too remarkable to be given, as it were,
in a parenthesis: it is therefore referred to a separate
head. Acts ix. 12. "And Paul hath seen in a
vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting
his hand on him that he might receive his sight."</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Topic 5.</span>&mdash;<i>Ananias's Objection to the Lord's Commands to visit
Paul&mdash;He informs the Lord what he had heard about Paul.</i></h5>

<p>By the two first speeches of this dialogue, we are
given to understand that Ananias had already held
intercourse with the Lord; an intercourse which, the
nature of the two parties considered, could not have
been other than a supernatural intercourse: yes, and
on this very subject: for, if not on this particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
subject, the subject of it, whatever it was, could not
but have called for notice and communication. But,
no sooner does this next speech commence, than we
are given to understand that there had not&mdash;could
not have been any such intercourse: for if there had
been, what follows would have been rendered useless
and needless. Upon receiving the command, Ananias's
first thought is&mdash;to endeavour to excuse himself
from paying obedience to it; for in this endeavour
it is, that he gives the Lord a piece of
information; to wit&mdash;of what, in relation to Paul's
character, he (Ananias) had heard. Acts ix. 13:
"Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by
many of this man, how much evil he hath done to
thy saints at Jerusalem. And here he hath authority
from the Chief Priests to bind all that call on thy
name." Thus then, commands known to have been
the Lord's, having that instant been received,&mdash;the
man by whom they have been received&mdash;so small
is the confidence, reposed in the Lord by this his
favoured disciple&mdash;instead of paying obedience to
them, answers them by an objection. This objection,
prepared for it or not prepared for it, the Lord, as
might well be expected, immediately overrules.</p>

<p>A question that here presents itself is&mdash;Since it
was from <i>many</i>, i.e. <i>many men</i>, that Ananias had
heard, not only what everybody had been hearing
for weeks, or months, or years,&mdash;viz. of the evil that
Paul had been doing to the Jerusalem saints, but of
the authority that he had so lately received, to bind
at Damascus all the Damascus saints he could find&mdash;since
it was from so many, who then were these
many? How was it, that in the compass of the three
days (ver. 9), during which Paul had remained without
sight or nourishment, a commission,&mdash;to the execution
of which secrecy was so obviously necessary,&mdash;had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
to such a degree transpired? Suppose the
secret to have thus transpired,&mdash;two results would,
in any natural and credible state of things, have
been among the consequences. The persons thus
devoted to destruction would have made their escape;
the commission by which alone the supposed
proceedings against them could have found a justification
or a cause, not having been delivered. On the
other hand, hearing that Paul was there, and that he
either was, or pretended to be, in the house in question,
or in some other, in the extraordinary condition
above described,&mdash;the persons spoken of in the Acts
under the name of <i>the Synagogue</i>, would not have
left him there, but would have convened him before
them, and, if he really had any such commission, have
caused it to be produced, and read it: convened before
them, not only Paul with his supposed commission,
but those companions of his that we have
already heard of, if any such he had<a name="FNanchor_8_10" id="FNanchor_8_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_10" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>
<p>But of these there will be occasion to speak in
another place.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Topic 6.</span>&mdash;<i>The Lord's Answer, obviating the objection, and giving
intimation of his designs in favour of Paul.</i></h5>

<p>This objection, no sooner has the Lord overruled
it, than he undertakes to answer it, and to explain
to this his so singularly favoured old disciple the intentions
he had formed in favour of his intended new
convert, whose conversion is, however, as yet but
in progress (ver. 14): "But the Lord said to him, Go
thy way; for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear
my name before the Gentiles and kings, and the children
of Israel:&mdash;For (continues the Lord) I will show
him how great things he must suffer for my name's
sake." Being, and therefore at the time of Paul's
vision purposing to be, in relation to his designs for
Paul, thus communicative to this same Ananias, who
is a perfect stranger to this same Paul,&mdash;to what
purpose, on the occasion of his supposed visionary
intercourse with Paul, should <i>the Lord</i> have stopped
short; reserving the communication, for the intention
of giving it him at second-hand by the mouth
of that same stranger? This is one of the swarms of
questions which an account of this sort could scarcely
fail to present to any inquiring mind.</p>

<p>Meantime, as to the Lord's having thus stopped
short, this we shall see is in full contradiction with
the account which the historian makes him give in his
supposed second reported speech, to wit, the supposed
premeditated one, spoken before Agrippa,
who, under the proconsul Festus, was king of the
Jews, and who, on that occasion, is spoken of as being
assessor to the said proconsul Festus. On that
occasion the Lord is represented as explaining himself
more fully to Paul himself, than here, for the
benefit of Paul, through Ananias.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<h4>SECTION 4.</h4>

<h5>ANANIAS: HIS VISIT TO PAUL AT DAMASCUS.</h5>

<p>We now come to the visit, which, we are to understand,
was, in reality, paid to Paul by Ananias, in
consequence of this vision, in obedience to the command
imagined to be given in it.</p>

<p>Note that, though, in the original&mdash;in <i>the including
vision</i>, as it may be called&mdash;the command is given to
inquire in the house in question for the person
(Saul) in question,&mdash;this is <i>all</i> the command which,
in that least visionary of the two visions, is delivered.
In the first instance to make the inquiry, and
in conclusion to go his way&mdash;this is all to which the
commands given to him in the direct way extend
themselves. To accomplish the object of this intercourse&mdash;to
do anything towards it beyond the making
of this inquiry&mdash;he has to take hints and to draw
inferences:&mdash;inferences from the Lord's speech,
which is thus continued, Acts ix. 12: "And (Paul)
<i>hath seen in a vision</i> a man named Ananias coming
in, and putting his hand on him that he might receive
his sight." From having been told what&mdash;in a vision,
to wit, this <i>contained or included vision</i>&mdash;this
same Paul had been <i>fancying</i> he <i>had</i> seen him
(Ananias) do&mdash;from this he was to conclude that it
was the Lord's will that he (Ananias) <i>should</i> do <i>in
reality</i> that which Paul had been fancying him to
have done; though the only effect, for the doing of
which it had so been fancied to have been performed,
had never been produced. This was what he was to
conclude was the Lord's will; although the Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
himself, who (if any person) should have known how
to speak plainly and beyond danger of misconception,
had forborne to tell him as much.</p>

<p>On the occasion of this important visit&mdash;this visit
of Ananias to Paul,&mdash;the double light&mdash;the light cast
by the first of the two oratorical accounts&mdash;to wit, the
supposed unpremeditated one, upon the historical
one&mdash;recommences.</p>

<p>Follows now&mdash;and from both sources&mdash;the account
of the interview, and of the cure performed in the
course of it.</p>


<h5>ACTS' ACCOUNT.&mdash;Ch. ix. ver. 17-22.</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting
his hands on him, said: Brother Saul, the Lord, <i>even</i> Jesus,
that <i>appeared</i> unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me,
that thou mightest receive thy sight, <i>and be filled with the Holy
Ghost</i>.&mdash;And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been
<i>scales</i>: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and <i>was baptized</i>.&mdash;And
when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then
was Saul <i>certain days</i> with the disciples which were <i>at Damascus</i>.&mdash;And
straightway he <i>preached</i> Christ in the synagogues, that he is
the Son of God.&mdash;But all that heard <i>him</i> were amazed, and said:
Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in
Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring
them bound unto the Chief Priests?&mdash;But Saul <i>increased the more</i>
in strength, and <i>confounded the Jews</i> which dwelt at <i>Damascus</i>,
proving that this is very Christ.</p></div>


<h5>PAUL'S ACCOUNT.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Acts</span>, Ch. xxii. ver. 12-16.</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>12. And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having
a good report of all the Jews which dwelt <i>there</i>,&mdash;Came unto me,
and stood, and said unto me: Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And

our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will,
and <i>see</i> that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.&mdash;For
thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast <i>seen</i>
and heard.&mdash;And now, why tarriest thou? arise, and <i>be baptized</i>, and
wash away thy sins; calling on the name of the Lord.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Topic 1.</span>&mdash;<i>On visiting Paul, Ananias's Introductory Speech&mdash;Preliminary
Recital.</i></h5>

<p>I. In the historical account, the speech has in it
several distinguishable parts.
</p>

<p>I. "Brother Saul."</p>

<p>First comes the address, in which Saul, the future
Paul, is addressed by disciple Ananias by the name
of <i>brother</i>. If, as between Jew and Jew, this was a
common form of salutation,&mdash;so far everything is in
order. But, if it was only in consideration of his
having been denominated a disciple, to wit, of Jesus,&mdash;the
salutation is rather premature: the conversion,
supposing it effected, is, at any rate, not yet declared.
Not only in the historical account is this
appellation employed, but likewise in the oratorical
one.</p>

<p>The attention of Paul being thus bespoken by his
visitor, mention is thereupon made of the purpose
of the visit.</p>

<p>I. In the first place comes a recital. "The Lord
(says he), even Jesus, that <i>appeared</i> unto thee on the
way as thou camest, hath sent me".... Unfortunately,
according to the historian himself, this assertion,
as we have seen already, is not true. In no manner
or shape did the Lord Jesus, or any other person,
make his appearance;&mdash;all that <i>did</i> appear was the
light&mdash;the light at midday: so he has just been writing,
and before the ink, if ink it was that he used,
was dry, already had he forgotten it.</p>

<p>This, however, is but a collateral averment:&mdash;a recital,
an episode, matter of <i>inducement</i>, as an English
lawyer would phrase it.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Topic 2.</span>&mdash;<i>Declared Purposes or Objects of the Visit.</i></h5>

<p>Purpose the first. "That thou mightest," says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Ananias, "receive thy sight." Thus says Ananias
in the historical account: in the supposed oratorical
one he is more concise. No supposed past occurrence
referred to:&mdash;no purpose declared. "Receive
thy sight" are the words.</p>

<p>Purpose the second. That thou mightest "be filled
with the Holy Ghost," says the historical account.
But in a succeeding passage what is the purpose,
which, in the supposed oratorical account Ananias is
made to speak of, in the design that it should be
taken for the purpose which the Lord by his commandment
meant to be accomplished? Not the being
filled by the Holy Ghost; only the being baptized.
"And now, why tarriest thou? (Acts xxii. ver. 16)
Arise and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling
on the name of the Lord." Well but (says somebody)
receiving the Holy Ghost, and being baptized,&mdash;by
these two expressions, is not one, and no more
than one effect&mdash;one and the same effect&mdash;to be
understood? No, in truth, if the historian himself
is to be believed. Turn to another chapter&mdash;the very
next chapter before this, Acts 12 to 17, and there
you will see, that the being baptized was one thing,
the receiving the Holy Ghost another thing, and
much more. For administering the ceremony of
baptism, a single Apostle, Philip, was sufficient:
whereas, for the causing the Holy Ghost to be received,
nothing less was requisite than the cooperation
of two Apostles, and those two commissioned
by the rest.</p>

<p>So serious always, according to this historian, was
the difference, that it was after he had been already
baptized, and baptized gratis in a crowd, that for the
power of conferring this benefit, whatever it was
that it was composed of, Sorcerer Simon made to the
two Apostles, those offers&mdash;those pecuniary offers&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
are said to have been no sooner made than
rejected. Acts 13 to 24.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Topic 3.</span>&mdash;<i>Actual Effects of the Visit, and the Application in consequence
made in the course of it.</i> &nbsp;Effect 1. <i>Scales fall from
Eyes, and Sight is received in consequence.</i></h5>

<p>In the historical narrative, the effect is as complete
as it is remarkable. Fall from his eyes a portion of
matter of the nature or resemblance of scales: whereupon
he receives sight forthwith.</p>

<p>In the supposed oratorical account, whatsoever
had been meant by scales, nothing is said of them.
Neither is the declaration made of the completeness
of the case quite so explicit. One look he gave&mdash;gave
to his wonder-working surgeon&mdash;and instead of its
being given forthwith&mdash;to give this one look required,
it should seem, if not a whole hour, at any
rate so little less, that any time less than an hour
could not&mdash;such, in this supposed unpremeditated
speech, was the anxiety felt for correctness&mdash;could
not be ventured to be particularized.</p>

<p>The more closely these scales, or things resembling
scales, are looked at, the more difficult will it be to
find them amount to anything. In no cure, performed
upon eyes in any natural way, in these our
days&mdash;upon eyes that have lost their sight&mdash;do any
scales fall off, or anything in any degree resembling
scales;&mdash;in no disorder of the eyes, known to have
place in these our days, do scales, or anything like
scales, come over the eyes. By the taking of matter
from the eyes, sight, it is true, is every now and then
restored: but this matter is not matter, foreign in
relation to the eye and exterior to it; but one of the
component parts called <i>humours</i> of the eye, which,
by losing its transparency having suspended the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
faculty of vision, is let out by a lancet; whereupon
not only is the faculty of sight restored, but the part
which had been extirpated restored likewise; and
without any expense in the article of miracles.</p>

<p>On the supposition of falsity,&mdash;quere the use of
this circumstance? <i>Answer.</i> To afford support to
the conception, that memory and not imagination
was the source from which the story was derived.
True it is, that, instead of support, a circumstance
exposed to contradiction would be an instrument of
weakness: if, for example, on the supposition that
Paul had no companions on the road, names indicative
of really existing and well-known persons had
been added, to the intimation given in the <i>Acts</i>, of
the existence of such companions. But to no such
hazard was the story of the scales exposed: not to
any great danger, on the supposition of the existence
of Paul's Ananias: not to any danger at all, upon
the supposition of his non-existence.</p>

<p>But, upon this occasion, now again once more present
themselves&mdash;present themselves to the mind's
eye&mdash;Paul's companions. That they were blinded at
all can scarcely, it has been seen, be believed, if on
this matter the historian himself is believed. For,
per Acts ix. 8, "they led him by the hand:" so, per
Paul 1st, Acts xxii. 11, "When I could not see for
the glory of that light, being led by the hand of
those that were with me, I came unto Damascus."
But if, notwithstanding so it was that <i>they</i> too were
blinded,&mdash;how was it with <i>their</i> eyes? Had <i>their</i>
eyes scales upon them? did these scales ever fall off?&mdash;if
so, by what means were they made to fall off?
<i>their</i> evidence would have been not much, if anything,
less impressive,&mdash;and it would have been
much less open to suspicion,&mdash;than Paul's evidence,
supposing him to have spoken of these scales&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
the historian, to whom, if he is to be believed, their
existence is so well known, did not take upon him
to represent Paul as saying that he did. But if so
it was, that, though rendered blind as Paul's, no
scales were superinduced upon, nor consequently
made to fall off, the eyes of those nameless and unknown
persons,&mdash;how came they to be superinduced
upon and made to fall off from the eyes of their singularly
favoured principal? If, for a length of time
more or less considerable, they really were made
blind,&mdash;it was, if the historian is to be believed, by
the same cause by which, in the instance of Paul's
eyes, this same effect was produced:&mdash;the same
cause, to wit an extraordinary light at noonday. If,
whatsoever was the matter with them, the eyes of
these ordinary persons could be set to rights without
a miracle, what need could there be of a miracle for
the producing the same desirable effect in the person
of this their leader or master, extraordinary as
this same leader or master was?</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Topic 4.</span>&mdash;<i>Baptism&mdash;was it performed? when, where, by whom, &amp;c.?</i></h5>

<p>The baptism thus spoken of&mdash;was it performed?
Yes: if you will believe the historian, speaking in
his own person, speaking in his own historical ac-
count: "And forthwith," in the first place, "Paul
recovered his sight;"&mdash;then, when, his sight having
been recovered, he was able to go about as usual,&mdash;he
arose and was baptized: baptized&mdash;that is say, as
from this expression taken by itself any one would
conclude&mdash;baptized, as soon as he arose, to wit, as
soon as water could be found for the purpose: that
water, which his guest Ananias, foreknowing what
was to come to pass, and what was to be done to
make it come to pass, might naturally be expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
to have provided, and this without any supernatural
foresight: in a word, without the expense of any
additional miracle in any shape:&mdash;the water being
thus ready upon the spot, and he in equal readiness
to administer it.</p>

<p>This, according to the historian, speaking in his
own person: but, when the time comes for giving an
account of the matter in the person of Paul himself,&mdash;to
wit in the supposed unpremeditated oratorical
speech,&mdash;then, for whatever it was that stopped him,
(whether the supposed urgency of the occasion on
which the supposed speech was supposed to be made,
or any thing and what else,) so it is, that he gives
not any such information: he leaves the matter to
hang in doubt:&mdash;a doubt, which, down to the present
day remains unsolved.</p>

<p>A command to this effect is spoken of as having
been given: thus much is said. But, what is not said
is&mdash;whether to this same command any or what obedience
was paid.</p>

<p>Thus it is that, instead of an <i>effect</i> which it seems
desired that we should consider as being produced,
what we see directly stated as being produced, is
nothing more than a <i>command</i>&mdash;a command, by
which, as by its cause, we are to suppose the effect
to have been produced. What is more, in the same
blind way, is intimation given us, of another and
very different effect&mdash;<i>the washing away of sins</i>&mdash;as
if produced by the first-mentioned physical operation;&mdash;namely,
by that of a man's being dipped in, or
sprinkled with, water: and thus it is, that from a
mere physical operation of the most trivial nature,
we are called upon to infer a spiritual and supernatural
effect of the most awful importance; the
spiritual effect stated as if it were produced by the
physical operation, to which it has no perceptible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
real relation&mdash;nothing but the mere verbal one thus
given to it; produced by it, and following it, as of
course&mdash;just as if sins were a species of dirt, which,
by washing, could as surely be got off as any other
dirt.<a name="FNanchor_9_11" id="FNanchor_9_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_11" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>And was he then really baptized? If so he was,
then also if, speaking in the person of his hero, the
historian is to be believed,&mdash;then also, by this ceremony,
the name of the Lord being at the same time
called upon,&mdash;then also were his sins washed away;
his sins washed away; the sinner, therefore and
thereby, put into the same case as if the sins had not
any of them been ever committed. How can it be
understood otherwise? for if, in and by this passage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
intimation&mdash;sufficiently perfect information&mdash;is
given, that the ceremony was performed&mdash;then also
is sufficiently perfect information given, that such
was the effect actually produced by it. "Arise"
(Ananias is made to say)&mdash;"<i>Arise and be baptized,
and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of
the Lord.</i>"</p>

<p>This is no light matter: if so it really were, that
according to the religion of Jesus, by such a cause,
such an effect was on that occasion produced;&mdash;that
such effect could, in a word, on any occasion, in any
case be produced,&mdash;that <i>murders</i>, or (not to embarrass
the question with conceits of local jurisprudence)
<i>killings</i> of men&mdash;killings of men by persecution
carried on, on a religious account&mdash;slaughters
of Christians by non-Christians&mdash;could thus, as in
Paul's case, be divested of all guilt, at any rate of
all punishment, at the hands of Almighty Justice;&mdash;if
impunity could indeed be thus conferred by the
sprinkling a man with water or dipping him in it,
then would it be matter of serious consideration&mdash;not
only what is the <i>verity</i> of that religion, but what
the <i>usefulness</i> of it, what the usefulness&mdash;with reference
to the present life at any rate, not to speak of a
life to come: what the usefulness of it; and on what
ground stands its claim to support by all the powers
of factitious punishment and factitious reward, at
the hands of the temporal magistrate.<a name="FNanchor_10_12" id="FNanchor_10_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_12" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Topic 5.</span>&mdash;<i>Performance of the Promise, supposed to have been made
by the Lord, in favour of Paul, to Ananias.</i></h5>

<p>If the supposed promise is inadequate to the occasion,
the supposed performance is still more inadequate
with reference to the promise.</p>

<p>In the supposed promise are two distinguishable
parts, and in neither of them is the one thing needful
to be found. Of these two parts, the only one in
which in any direct stage the matter of a promise is
contained, is the one last mentioned: it is the promise
to show him, (Paul) what sufferings he will have
to undergo in the course of the career, whatever it is,
in which he is about to engage: to wit, in name and
profession, the preaching the religion of Jesus: "for
I will show him," says the Lord, according to the
historian,&mdash;"I will show him how great things he
must suffer for my name's sake." If so it was, that
upon this promise, such as it is, performance never
followed, the regret for the failure need not be very
great. Whatsoever were the sufferings that he was
predestined to undergo, that which was <i>not</i> in the
nature of this foreshowing, was&mdash;the lessening their
aggregate amount; that which <i>was</i> in the nature of it
was&mdash;the making an addition to that same afflicting
aggregate; to wit, by constant and unavoidable anticipation
of the approach of such sufferings.</p>

<p>Of this talk, vague as it is, about sufferings, the
obvious enough object was&mdash;the giving exaltation to
the idea meant to be conveyed of the merits of the
hero:&mdash;an object, which, by this and other means,
has accordingly, down to the present day, in no small
degree been accomplished. So much as to sufferings:
as to enjoyments, by any idea entertained of
the enjoyments derived by him from the same source,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
this design would have been&mdash;not promoted, but
counteracted. But, when the time arrives, whether
the mass of suffering was not, to no small amount,
overbalanced by that of his enjoyments&mdash;meaning
always worldly sufferings and worldly enjoyments&mdash;the
reader will be left to judge.</p>

<p>Here then we have the only promise, which in any
direct way is expressed:&mdash;a promise which, in the
first place would have been useless, in the next place
worse than useless.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Topic 6.</span>&mdash;<i>Indirect Promise, that Paul shall spread the
Name of Jesus.</i></h5>

<p>In the whole substance of this promise, if there be
anything, which, with reference to the professed end&mdash;to
wit the giving extension to the religion of Jesus&mdash;would
have been of use, it is in the foregoing part
that it must be looked for. In this part then, if
there be any such matter to be found, it will be this:
to wit, a promise that he (Paul) shall bear, and
therefore that he shall be enabled to bear, the name
of the Lord, to wit, the name of Jesus, before the
classes of persons specified, to wit, the Gentiles, and
kings, and children of Israel: Acts ix. 15. But, only
in an indirect way is this solely material part of the
promise expressed: "He is a chosen vessel unto me,
to bear my name," &amp;c. <i>i.e.</i> When I chose him, it was
my design that he should do so. But, in the case of
the Lord, according to the picture drawn of him by
this historian, how very inconclusive evidence <i>intention</i>
is of <i>execution</i>, there will, in the course of this
work, have been abundant occasion to see.</p>

<p>Bear the name of Jesus? so far, so good. But for
this function no such special and supernatural commission
was necessary: without any such commission,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
the name of Jesus had been borne to the people
at large, if in this particular the Gospel history is
to be believed. Luke ix. 49, 50: "And John answered
and said, 'Master, we saw one casting out
devils in thy name: and we forbad him, because he
followed not with us.' And Jesus said unto him,
'Forbid him not, for he that is not against us, is
for us.'" How inadequate soever, with reference
to the professed end, to wit, giving extension to
the religion of Jesus, the promise was perfectly adequate,
and commensurate, to what we shall find to be
Paul's real design; to wit, the planting a Gospel of
his own, as, and for, and instead of, the Gospel of
Jesus. The Gospel of Jesus was the Gospel of
Jesus: and the Gospel, which, availing himself of the
name of Jesus, it was Paul's design and practice to
preach, was, as he himself declares,&mdash;as we shall see
him declaring in the plainest and most express
terms,&mdash;a Gospel of his own; a Gospel which was
not the Gospel of the Apostles, and which, for fear
of its being opposed by them, he kept studiously concealed
from those confidential servants and real associates
of Jesus, as may be seen in the following
passages: Gal. i. 9, 11, and 12; "As we said before,
so say I now again, If any man preach any other
Gospel unto you, than that ye have received, let
him be accursed.&mdash;But I certify you, brethren, that
the Gospel which was preached of me is not after
man.&mdash;For I neither received it of man, neither was
I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ."
Gal. 2:2: "And I went up by revelation, and communicated
unto them that Gospel which I preach
among the Gentiles; but privately to them which
were of reputation, lest by any means, I should
run, or had run, in vain."</p>

<p>In the course of Paul's dialogue with the voice on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
the road&mdash;that voice which we are given to understand
was the Lord's, <i>i.e.</i> Jesus's&mdash;the promise supposed
to be made to Paul, it must be remembered,
was&mdash;the promise to tell him, when in the city, what
he was to do. "What thou must do," says the historian
in his historical account:&mdash;"all things which
are appointed for thee to do," says the historian
in the supposed unpremeditated oratorical account,
which, in this so often mentioned first of the
speeches, he is supposed by the historian to have
delivered.</p>

<p>Among all these things,&mdash;one thing, which it is
manifestly the design of the historian, as it was that
of his hero, to make men believe, was accomplished:
to wit, the satisfying them what was the religious
doctrine, for the dissemination of which the expense
of this miracle was incurred. This, moreover, is the
promise; which, in the reading of the story everybody
looks for: this too is the promise which
in the reading of this same story, the believers
in the religion of Jesus have very generally
been in the habit of considering as performed.
Not in and by this history, however, will they have
any such satisfaction, when the matter comes to be
looked into. For, in respect of this information, desirable
as it is,&mdash;Paul is, in this strangely supposed
intercourse, put off&mdash;put off to another time and
place: put off, for no reason given, nor for any substantial
reason that can be imagined. Further on,
when a show of performing the promise comes to be
made, then, instead of accomplishment, we have
more evasion. Instead of furnishing the information
to Paul himself&mdash;to Paul directly&mdash;for, when
the time and place for performance comes, performance&mdash;what
the Lord is not supposed so much
as to profess to do, what he professes to do is&mdash;to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
make the communication to this man, who, his existence
being supposed, was an utter stranger to Paul&mdash;namely
to this Ananias. Well, and for the conveying
the information, in this indirect and inadequate
way&mdash;for conveying it to and through this same Ananias&mdash;what
is done?&mdash;as we have seen, what amounts
to nothing.</p>

<p>When, for affording the information&mdash;had any information
been intended to be afforded&mdash;the time
and place are come; when Ananias and Paul have
been brought together; what is it that, from the information
afforded us by the historian, we are to
understand, passed? <i>Answer</i>, that, after the scales
had fallen from his eyes, Paul was baptized; that he
ate meat, and that after he had eaten meat he was
strengthened: strengthened, we are warranted to
suppose, by the meat which he had so eaten. Moreover,
that somehow or other, in this large city he
was certain days&mdash;number not specified,&mdash;with certain
disciples&mdash;neither names nor number specified,&mdash;and
preached Christ in the synagogues, saying
that he was the son of God.</p>

<p>Thus far then we are got; and, of the supposed
revelation, in all this time nothing revealed. Promises,
put-offs, evasions&mdash;and, after all, no performance.</p>

<p>Among the purposes of this work, is the satisfying
the reader&mdash;not only that Paul received not any
revelation from the Almighty; but that, even upon
his own showing, never did he receive any such revelation:
that, on pretence of his having received it
from the Almighty by a special revelation, he
preached indeed a certain doctrine; but that this
doctrine was partly one of his own, contrary to that
of Jesus's apostles, and therefore contrary to that
of Jesus: and that, in the way of revelation, he never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
did receive anything; neither that doctrine of his
own which he preached, nor anything else.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Topic 7.</span>&mdash;<i>Doctrine, supposed to be preached by Paul at Damascus
in the synagogues.</i></h5>

<p>Straightway, if the historian is to be believed;&mdash;straightway
after being strengthened by the meat;&mdash;and
straightway after he had passed the certain days
with the disciples;&mdash;then did Paul preach Christ in
the synagogues&mdash;preach that he is the son of God.</p>

<p>Here, had he really preached in any such places&mdash;here
would have been the time, and the best time, for
telling us what, in pursuance of the supposed revelation,
he preached. For, whatever it was, if anything,
that he ever learnt from his supposed revelation, it
was not till he had learnt it, till he made this necessary
acquisition, that the time for beginning to
preach in the synagogues in question or anywhere
else was come. And, no sooner had he received it,
than then, when it was fresh in his memory&mdash;then
was the time for preaching it. But, never having
received any such thing as that which he pretended,
and which the historian has made so many people
believe, he received,&mdash;no such thing had he to preach
at any time or place.</p>

<p>Whatever of that nature he had had, if he had had
at any <i>time</i>, Damascus was not the <i>place</i>, at any rate
at <i>that time</i>, for him to preach it, or anything else,
in synagogues&mdash;in any receptacle so extensively open
to the public eye.</p>

<p>Preach, in the name of Jesus&mdash;in the name of that
Jesus, whose disciples, and with them whose religion,
he now went thither with a commission to exterminate,&mdash;preach
in that name he could not, without
proclaiming his own religion&mdash;his own perfidy;&mdash;his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
own rebellion, against the authorities, from which,
at his own solicitation, the commission so granted to
him had been obtained:&mdash;his own perfidious contempt&mdash;not
only of those Jerusalem rulers, but of
those Damascus authorities, from whom, for that
important and cruel purpose, he was sent to receive
instruction and assistance. At some seven-and-twenty
years distance in the field of time, and at we
know not what distance in the field of space, probably
that between Rome and Damascus, it was as
easy for the historian to affirm the supposed preaching,
as to deny it: but, as to the preaching itself,
whether it was within the bounds of moral possibility,
let the reader judge.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Topic 8.</span>&mdash;<i>Supposed Amazement of the People of Damascus at this
Paul's supposed preaching of Christ in the Synagogues
there.</i></h5>

<p>Had there really been any such preaching, well
might have amazement followed it. But there was
no such preaching, therefore no such amazement.
Had there been real preaching, and real amazement
produced by it&mdash;what would have been the subject
of the amazement! Not so much the audacity of the
preacher&mdash;for madmen acting singly are to be seen
in but too great frequency: not so much the audacity
of the speaker, as the supineness of the constituted
authorities; for, madmen acting in bodies in the
character of public functionaries have never yet been
visible. And if any such assemblage was ever seen,
many such would be seen, before any one could be
seen, whose madness took the course of sitting still,
while an offender against their authority, coming to
them single and without support,&mdash;neither bringing

at a public meeting, preaching against them, and
setting their authority at defiance.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Topic 9.</span>&mdash;<i>Matter of the Revelation, which, in and by the supposed
unpremeditated Oratorical Account, is supposed to have
been made.</i></h5>

<p>Forgetting what, as we have seen, he had so lately
been saying in his own person&mdash;in the person of
Paul,&mdash;he on this occasion, returns to the subject:
and more evasive is the result.</p>

<p>On this occasion&mdash;this proper occasion&mdash;what is it
that he, Paul, takes upon him to give an account of.&mdash;That
which the Lord had revealed to him?&mdash;revealed,
communicated in the supernatural way of
revelation, to him&mdash;Paul? No; but that which, according
to him,&mdash;if he, and through him the historian,
is to be believed,&mdash;the Lord communicated to
Ananias concerning him&mdash;Paul. The Almighty having
minded to communicate something to a man, and
yet not communicating to that man any part of it,
but communicating the whole of it to another! What
a proceeding <i>this</i> to attribute to the Almighty, and
upon such evidence!</p>

<p>Still we shall see, supposing it communicated, and
from such a source communicated&mdash;still we shall see
it amounted to nothing: to nothing&mdash;always excepted
the contradiction to what, in relation to this
subject, had, by this same historian, been a little before
asserted.</p>

<p>Observe what were the <i>purposes</i>, for which, by
this Ananias, Paul is supposed to be made to understand,
that God&mdash;the God, says he, of our fathers&mdash;had
chosen him.</p>

<p>1. Purpose the first&mdash;"To know his will." His
will, respecting what? If respecting anything to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
great purpose here in question, respecting the new
doctrine which, to this Paul, to the exclusion of the
Apostles of Jesus, is all along supposed to have been
revealed. Of no such doctrine is any indication anywhere
in these accounts to be found.</p>

<p>2. Purpose the second&mdash;"And see this just one."
Meaning, we are to understand, the person all along
spoken of under the name of the Lord; to wit, Jesus.
But, in the vision in question, if the historian is to be
believed, no Jesus did Paul see. All that he saw
was a light,&mdash;an extraordinary strong light at midday;
so strong, that after it, till the scales fell from
his eyes, he saw not any person in any place: and
this light, whatever it was, was seen by all that were
with him, as well as by him.</p>

<p>3. Purpose the third&mdash;"And shouldest hear the
voice of his mouth." Oh! yes; if what the historian
says in that other place is to be believed&mdash;hear a
voice he did; and if the historian is to be again believed,
that voice was the Lord's. But, by hearing
this voice, how was he distinguished? those that were
with him, according to the historian's own account,
heard it as well as he. And what was he the wiser?
This also, it is hoped, has been rendered sufficiently
visible&mdash;just nothing.</p>

<p>Purpose the fourth and last&mdash;"Thou shalt be his
witness (the Lord's witness), of everything thou
hast seen and heard:"&mdash;that is, of that which was
nothing, and that which amounted to nothing.</p>

<p>Unhappily, even this is not all: for, before the
subject is concluded, we must go back and take up
once more the supposed premeditated and studied
speech, which, on the second occasion, the self-constituted
Apostle is supposed to have made to the
Sub-king of the Jews, Agrippa, sitting by the side
of his superior&mdash;the Roman Proconsul, Festus.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>In the course of this long-studied speech,&mdash;to
whom, is the communication, such as it is,&mdash;to whom,
in an immediate way, and without the intervention of
any other person, is it supposed to be made? Not to
Ananias;&mdash;not to any such superfluous and unknown
personage;&mdash;not to Ananias, but to Paul himself: viz.
to the very person <i>by</i> whom this same communication,
supposed to have been made to him, is supposed
to be reported (Acts xxvi. 16 to 18): to this principal,
or rather, only person concerned:&mdash;to this one
person, the communication, such as it is, and to him
the whole of it at once, is supposed to be made.</p>

<p>Here then is this Ananias discarded:&mdash;discarded
with this vision of his, and that other vision which
we have seen within it: the communication, which,
speaking in the first place in his own person,&mdash;and
then, on one occasion, in the person of this same
hero of his&mdash;the historian had just been declaring,
was made&mdash;not to Paul, but to Ananias;&mdash;this all-important
communication, speaking again in this
same third person, but on another occasion&mdash;the discourse
being supposed to be a long-studied one&mdash;he
makes this same Paul declare, was given&mdash;not to any
Ananias, not to any other person&mdash;but directly to
him, Paul, himself.</p>

<p>Let us now see what it amounts to. In the most
logical manner, it begins with declaring the <i>purposes</i>
it is made for; and, when the purposes are declared,
all that it does is done. Ver. 16. "But now:
rise, and stand upon thy feet; for I have appeared
unto thee for this purpose."...In this purpose
are several parts: let us look into them one by one.</p>

<p>1. Part 1. "To make thee (says the Lord) a
minister and a witness, both of these things which
thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I
will appear unto thee." But, as to the things which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
he had seen, by this same account they amounted to
nothing but a glare of light. Here then was the
light to <i>bear witness of</i>, if it was worth while: but, as
to the <i>ministering</i>, here was nothing at all to minister
to: for the light was past, and it required no ministering
to, when it was present. Had it been the
light of a lamp&mdash;yes; but there was no lamp in the
case.</p>

<p>Thus much, as to these things which he had seen.
Thereupon comes the mention of those things "in
the which, the Lord is supposed to say, I will appear
unto thee!" Here, as before, we have another
put-off. If, in the way in question, and of the sort
in question, there had been anything said, here was
the time, the only time, for saying it. For immediately
upon the mention of this communication, such
as it is, follows the mention of what was due in consequence
of it, in obedience to the commands supposed
to be embodied in it, and by the light of the
information supposed to be conveyed by it. "Whereupon,
says he, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient
to the heavenly vision..."</p>

<p>Part 2. The purpose continued.&mdash;"Delivering thee
from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom
I now send thee." This, we see, is but a continuation
of the same put-off: no revelation, no doctrine,
no Gospel here. As to the doctrine&mdash;the Gospel&mdash;that
Gospel which he preached, and which he said
was his own, no such Gospel is on this occasion given
to him; and, not being so much as reported to have
been given to him on any other occasion, was it not
therefore of his own making, and without any such
supernatural assistance, as Christians have been
hitherto made to believe was given to him?</p>

<p>As to the deliverance from the people and from the
Gentiles, this is a clause, put in with reference to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
dangers, into which the intemperance of his ambition
had plunged him, and from whence in part it had
been his lot to escape. Here then the sub-king and
his Roman superior were desired to behold the accomplishment
of a prophecy: but the prophecy was
of that sort which came after the fact.&mdash;"Unto
whom now I send thee..." In this they were desired
to see a continuation of the prophecy: for, as
to this point, it was, in the hope of the prophet, of
the number of those, which not only announce, but
by announcing contribute to, their own accomplishment.</p>

<p>Part 3. The purpose continued.&mdash;"To open their
eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and
from the power of Satan unto God..." Still the
same nothingness: to his life's end a man might be
hearing stories such as these, and still at the end of
it be none the wiser:&mdash;no additional doctrine&mdash;no additional
gospel&mdash;no declaration at all&mdash;no gospel at
all&mdash;here.</p>

<p>Part 4. The purpose continued and concluded... "that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and
inheritance among them which are sanctified by
faith that is in me." Good. But this is not doctrine;
this is not gospel; this is not itself the promised
doctrine: but it is a description of the effect, of which
the promised doctrine was to be the cause.</p>

<p>Now it is, as we have just seen, that Paul is represented
as commencing his preaching, or sallying
forth upon his mission; preaching, from <i>instructions</i>
received in a supernatural way&mdash;received by revelation.
Yet, after all, no such <i>instructions</i> has he received.
Thrice has the historian&mdash;once in his own
person, twice in that of his hero&mdash;undertaken to produce
those instructions. But by no one, from first
to last, have they anywhere been produced.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>Truly, then, of his own making was this Gospel
which Paul went preaching; of his own making, as
well as of his own using; that Gospel, which he himself
declares to his Galatians was not of man, was
not, therefore, of those Apostles, to whom the opposition
made by him is thus proclaimed.</p>

<p>When, after having given in his own person an
account of a supposed occurrence,&mdash;an historian, on
another occasion, takes up the same occurrence; and,
in the person of another individual, gives of that
same occurrence another account different from, and
so different from, as to be irreconcileable with it;
can this historian, with any propriety, be said to be
himself a believer in this second account which he
thus gives? Instead of giving it as a true account,
does he not, at any rate, in respect of all the several
distinguishable circumstances in which it differs
from the account given in his own person&mdash;give it in
the character of a fable? a fable invented on the occasion
on which the other person is supposed to
speak&mdash;invented in the intent that it shall promote
the purpose for which this speech is supposed to be
made? Yet this account, which in the eyes of the
very man by whom it is delivered to us, is but a fable,
even those to whom in this same character of a fable
it is delivered&mdash;this account it is that <i>Christians</i>
have thus long persisted in regarding, supporting,
and acting upon, as if it were from beginning to end,
a truth&mdash;a great body of truth!&mdash;O Locke! O Newton!
where was your discernment!</p>

<p>On such evidence would any Judge fine a man a
shilling? Would he give effect to a claim to that
amount? Yet such is the evidence, on the belief of
which the difference between happiness and misery,
both in intensity as well as duration, infinite, we are
told, depends!</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<h4>SECTION 5.</h4>

<h5>VISION III.&mdash;PAUL'S ANTERIOR VISION, AS REPORTED BY
THE LORD TO ANANIAS.</h5>

<p>By the nature of the acts which are the objects of it,
the command, we see, is necessarily pregnant with
information: but now comes the information given
as such&mdash;the piece of information with which the
command is followed. This information&mdash;in and by
which another, an antecedent vision, is brought upon
the carpet, and communicated&mdash;has been reserved
for a separate consideration.</p>

<p>This information is in its complexion truly curious:
to present a clear view of it, is not an altogether
easy task. The information thus given by
the Lord&mdash;given to this Ananias&mdash;this information,
of which Paul is the subject, is&mdash;what? that, on some
former occasion, neither time nor place mentioned,
he, Ananias, to whom the Lord is giving the information,
had been seen by this same Paul performing,
with a certain intention, a certain action; the intention
being&mdash;that, in relation to this same Paul, a certain
effect should be produced&mdash;to wit, that of his
receiving his sight. The Lord declares, Acts ix. 12,
to Ananias, that Paul "had <i>seen in a vision</i> a man,
Ananias himself, coming and putting his hand on
him, that he (Paul) might receive his sight."</p>

<p>Well then&mdash;this action which the Lord thus informs
Ananias that he, Ananias, had performed,&mdash;did
he, at any time and place, ever perform it? Oh,
no; that is not necessary: the question is not a fair
one; for it was only in a vision that it was performed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Well then&mdash;if it was only in a vision that it was performed,
then, in reality, it was never performed.
The Lord said that it had been performed; but in so
saying the Lord had said that which was not true.
The Lord had caused him to believe this&mdash;the Lord
knowing all the while that it was not true. Such is
the deed, which, according to our historian, the Lord
relates himself to have achieved.</p>

<p>But the <i>intention</i>, was that true? Oh, no; nor was
there any need of its being so: for the intention, with
which the act was supposed to be performed, was
part and parcel of the divinely-taught untruth.</p>

<p>The effect, the production of which had been the
object of the intention, was it then&mdash;had it then been&mdash;produced?
Wait a little; no, not at that time. But
the time was not then as yet come; and now it is coming
apace.</p>

<p>But this effect&mdash;what is it? a man's receiving his
sight; this same Paul's receiving his sight; this same
Paul, of whom Ananias knew nothing, nor had ever
heard anything, except what he had just been hearing&mdash;to
wit, that, by a man of that name, he, Ananias,
had once been seen&mdash;seen to do so and so&mdash;he, all the
while&mdash;he, the doer, knowing nothing of what he was
doing&mdash;knowing nothing at all about the matter.
However, only in a vision did all this pass; which
being the case, no proper subject of wonder was afforded
to him by such otherwise somewhat extraordinary
ignorance.</p>

<p>But this sight&mdash;which, at the hands of this seer of
visions, to whom this information is thus addressed,
this stranger, whose name was still <i>Saul</i>, was to receive&mdash;how
happened it that it was to him, Ananias,
that he came to receive it? This faculty&mdash;at his
birth, was he not, like any other man, in possession
of it? If he was, what was become of it? In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
particular, the information thus supposed to have
been given by Omniscience, was rather of the scantiest.</p>

<p>Supposing the story to have any foundation in
truth,&mdash;such, to Ananias, it could not but have appeared;
and, supposing him bold enough to ask questions,
or even to open his mouth, a question, in the
view of finding a supply for the deficiency, is what
the assertion would naturally have for its first result.
No such curiosity, however, has Ananias: instead of
seeking at the hands of Omniscience an information,
the demand for which was so natural, the first use
he makes of his speech, or rather would have made
of it, if, instead of being imagined in a vision, the
state of things in question had been true, is&mdash;the furnishing
to Omniscience a quantity of information of
a sort in no small degree extraordinary. For, hereupon
begins a speech, in and by which Ananias undertakes
to give Omniscience to understand, what
reports, in relation to this same Paul, had reached
his (Ananias's) ears. What he is willing thus to
<i>speak</i> is more, however, than Omniscience is willing
to <i>hear:</i> the story is cut short, and the story-teller
bid to "go his way." "Then Ananias," says the
text, Acts ix. 13. "Then Ananias answered, Lord, I
have heard by many of this man, how much evil he
hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem. And here he
hath authority from the Chief Priests to bind all
that call on thy name. But the Lord said unto him,
Go thy way; for..." &amp;c.</p>

<p>But, though thus cut short, he is far from being in
disgrace. So far from it, that he is taken into confidence.
Then comes&mdash;still in a vision, and the same
vision&mdash;information of the till then secret acts and
intentions of Omnipotence in relation to this same
Paul: he had actually been "chosen" as "a vessel to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
bear the Lord's name before the Gentiles, and
kings, and the children of Israel:" and the determination
had been taken, says the Lord in this
vision, "to show him how great things he must suffer
for my name's sake." "For I will show him," says
the Acts, ix. 16, "how great things he must suffer
for my name's sake." And, with the announcement
thus made of this determination, the historical
account, thus by the historian in his own person
given, of this same vision, closes.</p>

<p>Thus highly distinguished, and favoured with a
confidence, equalling, if not surpassing, any which,
according to any of the Gospel accounts, appears
ever to have been imparted to any one of the
Apostles, how comes it that Ananias has never been
put in the number of the <i>Saints?</i> meaning always the
Calendar <i>Saints</i>&mdash;those persons, to wit, who, as a
mark of distinction and title of honour, behold their
ordinary names preceded by this extraordinary one?
Still the answer is: Aye, but this was but in vision:
and of a vision one use is&mdash;that of the matter of
which all that there is <i>not</i> a use for, is left to be taken
for false; all that there <i>is</i> a use for, is taken, and is to
pass, for true. When, by the name of Ananias, who,
humanly speaking, never existed but in name, the
service for which it was invented has been performed&mdash;to
wit, the giving a support to Paul and his vision,&mdash;it
has done all that was wanted of it: there is no,
further use for it.</p>

<p>Supposing that thirdly mentioned vision really
seen, at what point of time shall we place the seeing
of it? In this too there seems to be no small difficulty.</p>

<p>Between the moment at which Paul is said to have
had his vision, if a vision that can be called in which,
the time being midday, he saw nothing but a glare of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
light,&mdash;between the moment of this vision, of which
a loss of sight was the instantaneous consequence&mdash;between
the moment of this loss of sight and the moment
of the recovery of it, the interval is mentioned:
three days it was exactly. Acts ix. 9, "And he was
three days without sight, and neither did eat nor
drink."</p>

<p>The time during which, in verse 9, he has just been
declared to have been the whole time without sight,&mdash;this
is the time, within which he is declared&mdash;declared,
if the historian is to be believed, declared by
the Lord himself&mdash;to have seen this introductory
vision&mdash;this preparatory vision, for which it is so
difficult to find a use. And thus it is, that in a vision,
though <i>vision</i> means seeing, it is not necessary a
man should have sight.</p>

<p>Meantime, of all these matters, on which his own
existence, not to speak of the salvation of mankind,
so absolutely depends, not a syllable is he to know,
but through the medium of this so perfectly obscure
and questionable personage&mdash;this personage so completely
unknown to him&mdash;this same Ananias.</p>

<p>Three whole days he is kept from doing anything:
during these three whole days the business of the
miracle stands still. For what purpose is it thus
kept at a stand? Is it that there might be time sufficient
left for his learning to see, when his sight is
returned, this preparatory vision, by which so little
is done, and for which there is so little use?</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 6.</h4>

<h5>VISIONS, WHY TWO OR THREE INSTEAD OF ONE.</h5>

<p>As to the matter of fact designated by the words
<i>Paul's conversion</i>, so far as regards <i>outward</i> conversion,
the truth of it is out of all dispute:&mdash;that he
was <i>converted, i.e.</i> that after having been a persecutor
of the votaries of the new religion, he turned full
round, and became a leader. Whether the so illustriously
victorious effect, had for its cause a supernatural
intercourse of Paul with Jesus after his
resurrection and ascension, and thence for its accompaniment
an <i>inward</i> conversion&mdash;in this lies the
matter in dispute.</p>

<p>From those, by whom, in its essential particular,
the statement is regarded as being true, a natural
question may be&mdash;If the whole was an invention of
his own, to what cause can we refer the other vision,
the vision of Ananias? To what purpose should he
have been at the pains of inventing, remembering,
and all along supporting and defending, the vision of
the unknown supposed associate? Answer.&mdash;To the
purpose, it should seem, of giving additional breadth
to the basis of his pretensions.</p>

<p>Among that people, in those times, the story of a
vision was so common an article,&mdash;so difficultly distinguishable
from, so easily confounded with, on the
one hand the true story of a dream, on the other
hand a completely false story of an occurrence,
which, had it happened, would have been a supernatural
one, but which never did happen,&mdash;that a
basis, so indeterminate and arial, would seem to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
have been in danger of not proving strong enough to
support the structure designed to be reared upon it.</p>

<p>On the supposition of falsity, the case seems to be&mdash;that,
to distinguish his vision from such as in those
days were to be found among every man's stories, as
well as in every history,&mdash;and which, while believed
by some, were disbelieved and scorned by others,&mdash;either
Paul or his historian bethought himself of this
contrivance of a <i>pair</i> of visions:&mdash;a pair of corresponding
visions, each of which should, by reference
and acknowledgment, bear witness and give support
to the other: a <i>pair</i> of visions: for, for simplicity of
conception, it seems good not to speak any further,
of the antecedent vision interwoven so curiously in
the texture of one of them, after the similitude of
the flower termed by some gardeners <i>hose in hose</i>.</p>

<p>Of this piece of machinery, which in the present
instance has been seen played off with such brilliant
success upon the theological theatre, the glory of the
invention may, it is believed, be justly claimed, if not
by Paul, by his historian. With the exception of one
that will be mentioned presently<a name="FNanchor_11_13" id="FNanchor_11_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_13" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>, no similar one
has, upon inquiry, been found to present itself, in
any history, Jewish or Gentile.</p>

<p>The other pair of visions there alluded to, is&mdash;that
which is also to be found in the Acts: one of them
ascribed to Saint Peter, the other to the centurion
Cornelius.</p>

<p>Paul, or his historian?&mdash;The alternative was but
the suggestion of the first moment. To a second
glance the claim of the historian presents itself as incontestable.
In the case of Peter's pair of visions,
suppose the story the work of invention, no assignable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
competitor has the historian for the honour of
it: in the case of Paul's pair of visions, supposing
<i>that</i> the only pair, the invention was at least as likely
to have been the work of the historian as of the hero:
add to this pair the other pair&mdash;that other pair that
presents itself in this same work of this same history&mdash;all
competition is at an end. In the case of
even the most fertile genius, copying is an easier
task than invention: and, where the original is of a
man's own invention, copying is an operation still
easier than in the opposite case. That an occurrence
thus curious should find so much as a single
inventor, is a circumstance not a little extraordinary:
but, that two separate wits should jump in
concurrence in the production of it, is a supposition
that swells the extraordinariness, and with it the improbability,
beyond all bounds.</p>

<h4>SECTION 7.</h4>

<h5>COMMISSION TO PAUL BY JERUSALEM RULERS&mdash;COMMISSION
TO BRING IN BONDS DAMASCUS CHRISTIANS&mdash;PAUL'S
CONTEMPT PUT UPON IT.</h5>

<p>Per Acts, in the historical account, is stated the existence
of a commission:&mdash;granters, the Jerusalem
rulers; persons to whom addressed, Paul himself at
Jerusalem; and the synagogues, <i>i.e.</i> the rulers of
the synagogues, at Damascus: object, the bringing
in custody, from Damascus to Jerusalem, all Christians
found there: all adult Christians at any rate,
females as well as males; at Paul's own <i>desire</i>, adds
this same historical account (ix. 2.); "for to be punished,"
adds Paul 1st supposed unpremeditated oratorical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
account, xxii. 5. In the supposed premeditated
oratorical account, Paul 2nd, the existence of
authority and commission granted to him by the
Chief Priests is indeed mentioned, xxvi. 12: but, of
the object nothing is said.</p>

<p>In the unpremeditated oratorical account, such is
the boldness of the historian, nothing will serve him
but to make the orator call to witness the constituted
authorities&mdash;the Jerusalem rulers&mdash;whoever they
were, that were present,&mdash;to acknowledge the treachery
and the aggravated contempt he had been guilty
of towards themselves or their predecessors: towards
themselves, if it be in the literal sense that what on
this occasion he says is to be understood: "As also
the High Priest doth bear me witness, and all the
estate of the Elders, from whom also I received
letters," &amp;c., Acts xxii. 5. In the premeditated
oratorical account, the boldness of the orator is not
quite so prominent; he says&mdash;it was "with authority
and commission from the Chief Priests" at Jerusalem,
that he went to Damascus; but, for the correctness
of this statement of his, he does not now call
upon them, or any of them, to bear witness.</p>

<p>In respect of the description of the persons, of
whom the Jerusalem rulers, exercising authority in
their behalf, were composed,&mdash;the conformity, as
between the several accounts, is altogether entire.
In the historical account, it is the authority of the
High Priest, and the High Priest alone, that is exercised:
in the unpremeditated oratorical account,
it is that of the High Priest and all the estate of the
Elders: in the premeditated account, it is that of the
Chief Priests: nothing said either of High Priests
or Elders.</p>

<p>Neither, in the supposed unpremeditated oratorical
account, is it stated&mdash;that, at the time and place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
of the tumult, the rulers thus called to witness, or
any of them, were actually on the spot. But, the
spot being contiguous to the Temple&mdash;the Temple,
out of which Paul had been that instant dragged,
before there had been time enough for accomplishing
the determination that had been formed for
killing him,&mdash;the distance, between the spot, at which
Paul with the surrounding multitude was standing,
Paul being under the momentary protection of the
Roman commander&mdash;between this spot and the spot,
whatever it was, at which the question might have
been put to them, or some of them, could not be
great.</p>

<p>On the part of the historian, the boldness, requisite
for the ascribing the correspondent boldness to the
orator, may be believed without much difficulty. The
materials for writing being at hand, there was no
more danger in employing them in the writing of
these words, than in the writing of an equal number
of other words.</p>

<p>Not so on the part of the orator himself. For,
supposing the appeal made, the multitude might
have saved themselves the trouble of putting him to
death: the constituted authorities whom he was thus
invoking&mdash;those rulers, against whom, by his own
confession, he had committed this treason&mdash;would
have been ready enough to proceed against him in
the regular way, and take the business out of the
hands of an unauthorized mob.</p>

<p>The truth of the story, and for that purpose the
trustworthiness of the historian, being to be defended
at any rate,&mdash;by some people, all this contradiction,
all this mass of self-contradiction, will of
course be referred to <i>artlessness</i>, or, to take the
choice of another eulogistic word, to <i>simplicity:</i> and,
of trustworthiness, this amiable quality, whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
may be the name given to it, will be stated as constituting
sufficient proof. No such design, as that
of deceiving, inhabited, it will be said, his artless
bosom: no such design was he capable of harbouring:
for, supposing any such wicked design harboured
by him, could he have been thus continually
off his guard?</p>

<p>But&mdash;by all this self-contradiction, the quality
really proved is&mdash;not artlessness, but weakness: and,
with the desire of deceiving, no degree of weakness,
be it ever so high, is incompatible. By weakness,
when risen even to insanity, artfulness is not excluded:
and, in the fashioning, from beginning to
end, of all this story, art, we see, is by no means
deficient, how unhappily soever applied.</p>

<p>But the story being such as it is, what matters it,
as to the credence due to it, in what state, in respect
of probity, was the author's mind? Being, as it is,
to such a degree untrustworthy and incredible, as
that, in so many parts of it, it is impossible it should
have been true, the truth of it is impossible: what
matters it then, whether it be to the weakness of the
moral, or to that of the intellectual, quarter of the
author's mind, that the falsity is to be ascribed?</p>

<p>Not only in the whole does this history, anonymous
as it is, present satisfactory marks of <i>genuineness</i>,&mdash;that
is, of being written by the sort of person
it professes to be written by, namely, a person who in
the course of Paul's last excursion was taken into his
suite; but in many parts, so does it of <i>historic verity</i>.
True or not true,&mdash;like any other history ancient or
modern, it has a claim to be provisionally taken for
true, as to every point, in relation to which no adequate
reason appears for the contrary: improbability,
for example, of the supposed facts as related,
contradictoriness to itself, contradictoriness to other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
more satisfactory evidence, or probable subjection
to sinister and mendacity-prompting interest.</p>

<p>But, under so much self-contradiction as hath been
seen,&mdash;whether <i>bias</i> be or be not considered, could
any, the most ordinary fact, be regarded as being
sufficiently proved?</p>

<p>Meantime, let not any man make to himself a pretence
for rejecting the important position thus offered
to his consideration;&mdash;let him not, for fear of
its being the truth, shut his eyes against that which
is presented to him as and for the truth;&mdash;let him not
shut his eyes, on any such pretence, as that of its
being deficient in the quality of <i>seriousness</i>. If, indeed,
there be any such duty, religious or moral, as
that of <i>seriousness</i>; and that the stating as absurd
that which is really absurd is a violation of that
duty;&mdash;at that rate, <i>seriousness</i> is a quality, incompatible
with the delivery and perception of truth on
all subjects, and in particular on this of the most
vital importance: seriousness is a disposition to cling
to falsehood, and to reject truth. In no part has any
ridicule <i>ab extra</i>, been employed:&mdash;ridicule, by allusion
made to another object, and that an irrelevant
one.<a name="FNanchor_12_14" id="FNanchor_12_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_14" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<h4>SECTION 8.</h4>

<h5>COMPANIONS&mdash;HAD PAUL ANY UPON THE ROAD?</h5>

<p>Meantime, if all these miraculous visions and other
miracles must needs be supposed,&mdash;a cluster of other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
miracles, though not mentioned, must be supposed
along with them: miracles, for the production of
which a still greater mass of supernatural force must
have been expended. Here, their existence being supposed,
here were those companions of his, who, unknown
in names and number, saw or saw not all or
anything that he saw, and heard or heard not all or
anything that he heard. These men, at any rate, if
so it be that they themselves, blind or not blind, led
him, as it is said they did, into the city, because he
could not see to guide himself,&mdash;must, in some way
or other, have perceived that something in no small
degree extraordinary had happened to him: so extraordinary,
that, in the condition in which he was, and
in which, if they saw anything, they saw him to be&mdash;no
such commission, as that, for the execution of
which, if, as well as companions, they were his destined
assistants, they were put under his command,&mdash;could,
in any human probability, receive execution
at his hands. If they were apprised of this commission
of his, could they, whether with his consent
or even without his consent, avoid repairing to the
constituted authorities to tell them what had happened?
This commission of his, so important in
itself, and granted to a man of letters by men of
letters, could not but have been in writing: and accordingly,
in the form of letters we are, by the historian,
expressly informed it was. Of the existence
of these letters, on the tenor of which their future
proceedings as well as his depended,&mdash;these conductors
of his, if <i>he</i> did not, with or without his consent
would of course have given information, to the rulers
to whom these same letters were addressed. Not being
struck dumb, nor having, amongst the orders
given by the voice, received any order to keep silence,
or so much as to keep secret anything of what little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
they had heard, they would scarcely, under these circumstances,
have maintained either silence or secrecy.
The historian, knowing what he (the historian)
intended to do with his hero&mdash;knowing that, at
three days' end, he intended not only to make scales
fall from his eyes, but to fill his belly,&mdash;might not
feel any great anxiety on his account. But Paul
himself, if he, in the condition he is represented in
by the historian,&mdash;was, for three days together, with
scales on his eyes, and nothing in his stomach: and,
at the end of the three days, as ignorant as at the
beginning, whether the scales would, at any time,
and when, drop off, and his stomach receive a supply:
in such a state surely, a man could not but feel
a curiosity, not unattended with impatience, to know
when and how all this was to end. Under these circumstances,
by some means or other, would all these
tongues have been to be stopped: otherwise, instead
of the house of Judas in Straight-street, Paul might
have had no other place, to receive his visitor in,
than the town jail, or some one other of those strong
places, into which visitors do not always find it more
easy to gain entrance, than inmates to get out.</p>

<p>These tongues then&mdash;Paul's tongue, his companions'
tongues&mdash;this assemblage of tongues, all so
strongly urged to let themselves loose&mdash;by what
could they have been stopped? If, by anything, by a
correspondent cluster of miracles&mdash;nothing less.</p>

<p>That, from Jerusalem, about the time in question,
Paul went to Damascus,&mdash;and that it was with some
such letters in his possession,&mdash;seems, as will be seen
presently, altogether probable;&mdash;also, that when
there, he acted in the way his historian speaks of,
betraying the confidence reposed in him by the constituted
authorities, and joining with those whom he
had solicited and received a commission to destroy;&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
these were among the circumstances of his alleged
conversion, seems probable enough:&mdash;though
he, with all the need he had of miracles, if any were
to be had, gives not&mdash;in what he himself, writing to
his Galatian converts, says of his conversion&mdash;any
of the slightest hint of them.</p>

<p>As to his conversion&mdash;meaning his <i>outward</i> conversion,
which was all that was necessary to the production
of the effect so notoriously produced by him&mdash;to
<i>that</i>, it will be seen, no miracle was necessary:
nothing but what belonged to the ordinary course
of things. As to companions on the journey&mdash;whether
he had any or not; and if he had any,
whether they were attendants on his orders, or acquaintances
of his not under his orders; or mere
strangers into whose company accident threw him&mdash;all
this we must satisfy ourselves, as well as we can,
under the ignorance of.</p>

<p>That, for giving effect, by his means, to the sort of
commission he went entrusted with, the power of
local authorities was trusted to, is a supposition altogether
natural. For bringing to Jerusalem
"bound, for to be punished (Acts ix. 2. xxii. 4), all
the Christians that could be found in Damascus,
both men and women," if the Damascus rulers were
favourable to the persecuting design, no large force
from Jerusalem could be needful. Even a small one
would be superfluous: and, by a force, great or small,
sent from the one set of constituted authorities, a
slight would be shown to the other.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<h4>SECTION 9.</h4>

<h5>IN PAUL'S EPISTLE TO HIS GALATIANS,&mdash;BY HIS SILENCE,
ACTS' ACCOUNTS OF HIS CONVERSION ARE VIRTUALLY
CONTRADICTED.</h5>

<p>Of Paul's <i>outward</i> conversion&mdash;conversion from the
character of an authorized persecutor of the religion
of Jesus, to that of a preacher of a religion preached
in the name of Jesus&mdash;such, as we have seen, is the
account given in the Acts; given by the author of the
Acts, and by him alone. For, what ought never to be
out of mind, if instead of two different accounts&mdash;declared
by him as having been, on different occasions,
delivered by Paul&mdash;he had given two hundred,
still they would have been his:&mdash;not Paul's, but his.</p>

<p>All this while, now for little less than 1800 years,
from Paul's own pen we have an account of this his
conversion: and, of any such story as that of its being
effected through the instrumentality of visions,&mdash;in
this account of his, not any the slightest trace
is to be found;&mdash;not any the slightest allusion to it.</p>

<p>At the time of his giving this account&mdash;supposing
this story of the mode of his conversion true&mdash;supposing
even that, though false, it had been got up and
propagated&mdash;at the time of his giving the account
which bears such unquestionable marks of being his,
was the occasion such as to render it probable, that
he could thus have omitted all allusion, to an occurrence
at once so extraordinary and so important?
If not, then so it is&mdash;that, by the silence of Paul himself,
the story related by his historian is virtually
contradicted.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>The occasion here in view is&mdash;that of his writing
the so often mentioned, and so often about to be
mentioned, Epistle to his Galatian disciples.</p>

<p>At the time of his writing this letter, so we shall
have occasion to see over and over again in the tenor
of it, he was acting in opposition&mdash;declared and violent
opposition&mdash;to the Apostles: struggling with
them for the mastery; declaring that to them he
was not beholden for anything;&mdash;that the Gospel he
preached was not their Gospel, but a Gospel of his
own, received by him directly from Jesus;&mdash;declaring,
that in Jerusalem itself, the seat of their authority,
he had preached this Gospel of his, which
was not theirs; but confessing, at the same time, that
when he did so, it was in a secret manner, for fear
of the opposition, which he well knew, had they
known of it, they could not but have made to it.</p>

<p>In this state of contention&mdash;supposing any such
miracle as that in question wrought in his favour&mdash;was
it in the nature of the case that he should have
failed to avail himself of it?&mdash;to avail himself of the
account which the truth&mdash;the important truth&mdash;would
have so well warranted him in giving of it?
Supposing it true, had there at that time been witnesses
to it&mdash;any percipient witnesses&mdash;the supposed
Ananias&mdash;the supposed companions on the
road,&mdash;would he have failed making his appeal to
their testimony? Supposing even that there were
none such left, the truth of the occurrence&mdash;of an
occurrence of such momentous importance, would it
not have inspired him with boldness, sufficient for
the assertion of it, with all that intensity for which
the case itself furnished so sufficient a warrant, and
which the vehemence of his character would have
rendered it so impossible for him to avoid? Supposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
even the story an utter falsehood, yet, had it been
at this time got up and promulgated, could he, if he
saw any tolerable prospect of its obtaining credence,
have failed to endeavour to avail himself of it?</p>

<p>No, surely. Yet, in this his address, made to his
Galatian disciples, and to all such inhabitants of that
country, as he could see a prospect of numbering
among his disciples&mdash;in this address, written under
a sense of the necessity he was under, of making for
his support against the Apostles, the most plausible
case his ingenuity could enable him to make,&mdash;not
any, so much as the slightest, hint of any such miracle,
does he venture to give. <i>Revelation!</i> <i>revelation!</i>&mdash;on
this single word&mdash;on the ideas, which, in the
minds with which he had to deal, he hoped to find
associated with that word&mdash;on this ground, without
any other, did he see himself reduced to seek support
in his contest with the Apostles. Revelation? revelation
from Jesus? from the Lord, speaking from
heaven? from the Almighty? On what occasion, in
what place, at what time, in what company, if in any,
was it thus received? To no one of these questions
does he venture to furnish an answer&mdash;or so much
as an allusion to an answer. Why?&mdash;even because
he had none to give. He had been a persecutor of
the disciples of Jesus&mdash;this he confesses and declares:
he became a preacher in the name of Jesus&mdash;this
he also declares; a preacher in the name of him,
of whose disciples&mdash;the whole fellowship of them&mdash;he
had been a persecutor&mdash;a blood-thirsty and blood-stained
persecutor. His conversion, whatever it
amounted to, how came it about? what was the cause,
the time, the place, the mode of it; who the percipient
witnesses of it? To all these questions, <i>revelation</i>;
in the single word is contained all the answer,
which&mdash;in this letter&mdash;in this plea of his&mdash;he, audacious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
as he was, could summon up audacity enough
to give. Why, on so pressing an occasion, this forbearing?
Why? but that, had he ventured to tell
any such story, that story being a false one, there
were his opponents&mdash;there were the Apostles, or
men in connection with the Apostles&mdash;to contradict
it&mdash;to confute it.</p>

<p>Had he made reference to any specific, to any individual,
portion of place and time, the pretended
facts might have found themselves in contradiction
with some real and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'proveable'">provable</ins> facts. But, time as
well as place being left thus unparticularized,&mdash;he
left himself at liberty, on each occasion, if called
upon for time or place, to assign what portion of
time and place the occasion should point out to him
as being most convenient;&mdash;best adapted to the purpose
of giving lodgment to an appropriate falsity;&mdash;and
without danger, or with little danger, of exposure.</p>

<p>At distinct and different times, <i>five</i> interviews we
shall see him have, with the Apostles&mdash;one or more
of them: the first interview being,&mdash;according to his
own account, as given in this very Epistle,&mdash;at little
if anything more, than three years' distance from
the time of his quitting the occupation of persecution.
Then, says he, it was, Gal. i. 17 and 18, that
"I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode
with him fifteen days." In all these days, is it
possible, that, if the conversion miracle had really
taken place as stated in the Acts, with the companions
on the road and Ananias for witnesses,&mdash;he
should not have related to Peter, and, if not spontaneously,
at any rate in answer to such questions as a
man in Peter's situation could not fail to put, have
brought to view, every the minutest circumstance?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
This then was the time&mdash;or at least <i>one</i> time&mdash;of his
trial, on the question, <i>revelation or no revelation</i>.
Here then, when, with such vehemence, declaring&mdash;not
his independence merely, but his superiority, in
relation to the Apostles&mdash;and <i>that</i> on no other
ground than this alleged revelation, was it, had the
judgment in that trial been in his favour&mdash;was it
possible, that he should have omitted to avail himself
of it? Yet no such attempt, we see, does he
make:&mdash;no attempt, to avail himself of the issue of
the trial, or of anything that passed on the occasion
of it. Altogether does he keep clear of any allusion
to it: and indeed, if his historian&mdash;the author of the
Acts&mdash;is to be believed,&mdash;with very good reason: for,
whatever it was that, on that occasion, he said, in
the Acts it is expressly declared that, by the disciples
at least, he was utterly disbelieved. Acts ix. 26: "He
assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they
were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was
a disciple. But Barnabas took him and brought
him to the Apostles," &amp;c. Why it was, that, after
the disciples had thus unanimously declared him and
his story unworthy of credit, the Apostles gave him
notwithstanding a sort of reception;&mdash;and that, by
no countenance, which they on that occasion gave
him, was any ground afforded, for the supposition
that any more credence was given to him and his
story, by them than by the disciples at large,&mdash;will
be explained in its place.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<h4>INTERVIEWS, A.D. 35 (I); A.D. 52 (III).</h4>

<h5>As per Paul, Gal. A.D. 58.</h5>

<h5>1. <i>Introduction.</i></h5>

<p>Gal. 1:1. "Paul, an apostle, not from men, neither through man,
but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him
from the dead, and all the brethren which are with me, unto the
churches of Galatia: Grace to you and peace from God the Father,
and our Lord Jesus Christ, who gave himself for our sins, that
he might deliver us out of this present evil world, according to
the will of our God and Father: to whom be the glory for ever
and ever. Amen."</p>

<h5>2. <i>Independence Declared.</i></h5>

<p>Gal. 1:6. "I marvel that ye are so quickly removing from him
that called you in the grace of Christ unto a different gospel;
which is not another gospel: only there are some that trouble
you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. But though we,
or an angel from heaven, should preach unto you any gospel other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
than that which we preached unto you, let him be anathema. As
we have said before, so say I now again, if any man preacheth
unto you any gospel other than that which ye received, let him be
anathema. For am I now persuading men, or God? or am I seeking
to please men? if I were still pleasing men, I should not be a
servant of Christ.</p>

<p>"For I make known to you, brethren, as touching the gospel
which was preached by me, that it is not after man. For neither
did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me
through revelation of Jesus Christ."</p>


<h5>3. <i>Conversion Spoken Of.</i></h5>

<p>Ver. 13. "For ye have heard of my manner of life in time past
in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the
church of God, and made havock of it: and I advanced in the
Jews' religion beyond many of mine own age among my countrymen,
being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my
fathers. But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated
me, even from my mother's womb and called me through his
grace, to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the
Gentiles; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood: neither
went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me:
but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned unto Damascus."</p>


<h5>4. <i>Account of Interview I.</i></h5>

<p>Ver. 18. "Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit
Cephas, and tarried with him fifteen days. But other of the apostles
saw I none, save James the Lord's brother. Now touching the
things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not. Then
I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia. And I was still
unknown by face unto the churches of Judea which were in Christ:
but they only heard say, He that once persecuted us now preacheth
the faith of which he once made havock; and they glorified God
in me."</p>


<h5>5. <i>Account of Interview III. II.</i></h5>

<p>Gal. 2:1. "Then after the space of fourteen years I went up
again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
And I went up by revelation; and I laid before them the gospel
which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately before them who
were of repute, lest by any means I should be running, or had
run, in vain. But not even Titus who was with me, being a Greek,
was compelled to be circumcised: and that because of the false
brethren privily brought in, who came in privily to spy out our
liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us
into bondage: to whom we gave place in the way of subjection,
no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue
with you. But from those who were reputed to be somewhat
(whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth
not man's person)&mdash;they, I say, who were of repute imparted
nothing to me: but contrariwise, when they say that I had been
intrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision, even as Peter
with the gospel of the circumcision, for he that wrought for Peter
unto the apostleship of the circumcision wrought for me also unto
the Gentiles."</p>


<h5>6. <i>Partition Treaty.</i></h5>

<p>Ver. 9. "And when they perceived the grace that was given unto
me, James and Cephas and John, they who were reputed to be
pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship,
that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision;
only they would that we should remember the poor; which
very thing I was also zealous to do."</p>


<h5>7. <i>Jealousy, Notwithstanding.</i></h5>

<p>Ver. 11. "But when Cephas (Peter) came to Antioch, I resisted
him to the face, because he stood condemned. For before that
certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when
they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing them that
were of the circumcision. And the rest of the Jews dissembled
likewise with him; insomuch that even Barnabas was carried away
with their dissimulation. But when I saw that they walked not
uprightly according to <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'he'">the</ins> truth of the gospel, I said unto Cephas
before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest as do the Gentiles,
and not as do the Jews, how compellest thou the Gentiles to live
as do the Jews? We being Jews by nature, and not sinners of
the Gentiles, yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works
of the law, save through faith in Jesus Christ, even we believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
on Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ,
and not by the works of the law: because by the works of the
law shall no flesh be justified. But if, while we sought to be
justified in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, is Christ
a minister of sin? God forbid. For if I build up again those
things which I destroyed, I prove myself a transgressor. For I
through the law died unto the law, that I might live unto God.
I have been crucified with Christ; yet I live; and yet no longer I,
but Christ liveth in me: and that life which I now live in the
flesh I live in faith, the faith which is in the Son of God, who
loved me, and gave himself up for me. I do not make void the
grace of God: for if righteousness is through the law, then Christ

Barnabas as far as Antioch: who, when he was come, and had seen
the grace of God, was glad; and he exhorted them all, that with

<h5>As per <span class="smcap">Acts</span> xv. 1-21.</h5>

<p>Acts 25:1-23. "And certain men came down from Judea and
taught the brethren, saying, Except ye be circumcised after the
custom of Moses, ye cannot be saved. And when Paul and Barnabas
had no small dissension and questioning with them, the brethren
appointed that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them,
should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this
question. They therefore, being brought on their way by the
church, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the
conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the
brethren. And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were
received of the church and the apostles and the elders, and they
rehearsed all things that God had done with them. But there
arose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees who believed, saying,
It is needful to circumcise them, and to charge them to keep the
law of Moses.</p>

<p>"And the apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider
of this matter. And when there had been much questioning
Peter rose up, and said unto them,</p>

<p>"Brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice
among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word
of the gospel, and believe. And God, which knoweth the heart,
bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
unto us; and he made no distinction between us and them, cleansing
their hearts by faith. Now therefore why tempt ye God, that
ye should put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither
our fathers nor we were able to bear? But we believe that we
shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in like manner
as they.</p>

<p>"And all the multitude kept silence; and they hearkened unto
Barnabas and Paul rehearsing what signs and wonders God had
wrought among the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Gentile'">Gentiles</ins> by them. And after they had held
their peace, James answered, saying,</p>

<p>"Brethren, hearken unto me: Symeon hath rehearsed how first
God did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his
name. And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is
written,</p>

<p>"Wherefore my judgment is, that we trouble not them which
from among the Gentiles turn to God; but that we write unto them,
that they abstain from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication,
and from what is strangled, and from blood. For Moses from
generations of old hath in every city them that preach him, being
read in the synagogues every sabbath."</p>

<p>Acts 15:22-33. "Then it seemed good to the apostles and the
elders, with the whole church, to chose men out of their company,
and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas
called Barsabbas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren: and they
wrote thus by them, The apostles and the elder brethren unto the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: missing word 'brethren' added">brethren</ins>
which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greeting:
Forasmuch as we have heard that certain which went out
from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls; to
whom we gave no commandment; it seemed good unto us, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
come to one accord, to choose out men and send them unto you with
our beloved Barnabas and Paul, men that have hazarded their
lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. We have sent therefore
Judas and Silas, who themselves also shall tell you the same
things by word of mouth. For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost,
and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary
things; that ye abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from
blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from
which if ye keep yourselves, it shall be well with you. Fare
ye well.</p>

<p>"So they, when <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'the'">they</ins> were dismissed, came down to Antioch; and
having gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle.
And when they had read it, they rejoiced for the consolation. And
Judas and Silas, being themselves also prophets, exhorted the
brethren with many words, and confirmed them. And after they
had spent some time there, they were dismissed in peace from the
brethren unto those that had sent them forth."</p>

that ministered unto him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed
in Asia for a while."</p>

<h5>(<i>Visit Again Proposed. A.D.</i> 60.)</h5>

<p>Acts 20:16. "For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, that
he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hastening,
if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.</p>

<p>"And from Miletus he went to Ephesus, and called to him the
elders of the church. And when they were come to him, he said
unto them,</p>

<p>"Ye yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia,

declaring unto you anything that was profitable, and teaching you
publicly, and from house to house, testifying both to Jews and
to Greeks repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord
Jesus Christ. And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto
Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there: save
that the Holy Ghost testifieth unto me in every city, saying that
bonds and afflictions abide me. But I hold not my life of any
account, as dear unto myself, so that I may accomplish my course,
and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify
the gospel of the grace of God. And now, behold, I know that
ye all, among whom I went about preaching the kingdom, shall
see my face no more."</p>

feet and hands, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the
Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall
deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles. And when we heard
these things, both we and they of that place besought him not to
go up to Jerusalem. Then Paul answered, What do ye, weeping
and breaking my heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but
also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus. And
when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of
the Lord be done."</p>

us gladly."</p>

<h5><i>Test, Proposed for Riddance.</i></h5>

<p>"And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and
all the elders were present. And when he had saluted them, he
rehearsed one by one the things which God had wrought among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
the Gentiles by his ministry. And they, when they heard it, glorified
God; and they said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many
thousands there are among the Jews of them which have believed;
and they are all zealous for the law: and they have been informed
concerning thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among
the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their
children, neither to walk after the customs. What is it therefore?
they will certainly hear that thou art come. Do therefore this that
we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them;
these take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges for
them, that they may shave their heads: and all shall know that
there is no truth in the things whereof they have been informed
concerning thee; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, keeping
the law. But as touching the Gentiles which have believed, we
wrote, giving judgment that they should keep themselves from
things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what is
strangled, and from fornication."</p>

<p>"Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself
with them went into the temple, declaring the fulfilment of the
days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one
of them."</p>

<h5><i>Indignation Universal.</i></h5>

<p>"And when the seven days were almost completed, the Jews
from Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the
multitude, and laid hands on him, crying out, Men of Israel, help:
This is the man, that teacheth all men everywhere against the
people, and the law, and this place: and moreover he brought Greeks
also into the temple, and hath defiled this holy place. For they
had before seen with him in the city Trophimus the Ephesian,
whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple. And
all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they
laid hold on Paul, and dragged him out of the temple: and straightway
the doors were shut. And as they were seeking to kill him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
tidings came up to the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem
was in confusion. And forthwith he took soldiers and centurions,
and ran down upon them: and they, when they saw the chief
captain and the soldiers, left off beating Paul. Then the chief
captain came near, and laid hold on him, and commanded him to be
bound with two chains; and inquired who he was, and what he had
done. And some shouted one thing, some another, among the
crowd: and when he could not know the certainty for the uproar, he
commanded him to be brought into the castle. And when he came
upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for
the violence of the crowd; for the multitude of the people followed
after, crying out, Away with him."</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_3" id="Footnote_1_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_3"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Of the word <i>conversion</i>, as employed everywhere and in all
times in speaking of Paul, commonly called Saint Paul, the import
has been found involved in such a cloud, as, on pain of perpetual
misconception, it has been found necessary, here at the outset, to
clear away. That, from being an ardent and destructive persecutor
of the disciples of the departed Jesus, he became their collaborator,
and in <i>that</i> sense their ally,&mdash;preaching, in speech, and by writing,
a religion under the name of the religion of Jesus, assuming even
the appellation of an <i>Apostle</i> of Jesus,&mdash;<i>Apostle</i>, that is to say,
special envoy&mdash;(that being the title by which the twelve most confidential
servants of Jesus stood distinguished), is altogether out
of dispute. That in this sense he became a <i>convert</i> to the religion
of Jesus, and that in this sense his alleged conversion was real,
is accordingly in this work not only admitted, but affirmed. Few
points of ancient history seem more satisfactorily attested. In this
sense then he was converted beyond dispute. Call this then his <i>outward
conversion</i>; and say, Paul's <i>outward conversion</i> is indubitable.
But, that this conversion had for its cause, or consequence,
any supernatural intercourse with the Almighty, or any belief in
the supernatural character of Jesus himself; this is the position,
the erroneousness of which has, in the eyes of the author, been
rendered more and more assured, the more closely the circumstances
of the case have been looked into. That, in speech and
even in action, he was in outward appearance a convert to the religion
of Jesus; this is what is admitted: that, inwardly, he was
a convert to the religion of Jesus, believing Jesus to be God, or
authorized by any supernatural commission from God; this is the
position, the negative of which it is the object of the present work
to render as evident to the reader, as a close examination has rendered
it to the author. The consequence, the practical consequence,
follows of itself. In the way of doctrine, whatsoever, being in the
Epistles of Paul is not in any one of the Gospels, belongs to Paul,
and Paul alone, and forms no part of the religion of Jesus. This
is what it seemed necessary to state at the opening; and to this,
in the character of a conclusion, the argument will be seen all
along to tend.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_5" id="Footnote_3_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_5"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> In regard to the matter testified, that is, in regard to the
object of the testimony; it is, first of all, a requisite condition, that
what is reported to be true should be possible, both absolutely, or
as an object of the elaborative Faculty, and relatively, or as an
object of the Presentative Faculties,&mdash;Perception, External or Internal.
A thing is possible absolutely, or in itself, when it can be
construed to thought, that is, when it is not inconsistent with the
logical laws of thinking; a thing is relatively possible as an object
of perception, External or Internal, when it can affect Sense or
Self-consciousness, and, through such affection, determine its apprehension
by one or other of these faculties.
</p>
<p>
A testimony is, therefore, to be unconditionally rejected, if the
fact which it reports be either in itself impossible, or impossible as
an object of the representative faculties.
</p>
<p>
But the impossibility of a thing, as an object of these faculties,
must be decided either upon physical, or upon metaphysical, principles.

A thing is physically impossible as an object of sense, when the

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_6" id="Footnote_4_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_6"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> "<i>Light</i>,&mdash;great <i>Light</i>."&mdash;It will be noticed that this "light" is
presented first objectively as a phenomenon, a thing, But <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'was'">what</ins> is
"light"? The universal answer is "That force in nature which,
acting on the Retina of the eye produces the sensation we call
vision." This vision is the total of the subjective effect of that
agency of Nature, the subjective realization through the functions
of the Cerebellum. But functions are accomplished through agencies
called organs. The retina is one of these organs. Through the operations
of these organs and cerebellum subjective apprehension is
produced as an effect, but in some cases of very forcible apprehensions
they are interpreted as a diseased condition of the organs of
sense. Ideas sometimes acquire unusual vividness and permanence
and are, therefore, peculiarly liable to be mistaken for their objective
prototypes and hence specters, spectral allusions which are
very common in cases of emotional excitement.
</p>
<p>
Further, it will be noticed all the time that the reporter, Luke,
wrote what Paul, or some other person or rumor had previously
communicated to him. Now Luke, was accustomed to pen these
wonders, these superhuman Chimerical prodigies. Take the example
of the trial of Stephen, Acts 7. After the Charges of the
Complainants, Ib. 6-9, "Libertines" and others had been heard
by the High Priest, he inquired of Stephen personally as to the
verity of the charges, And Luke reports his responses, And then
to make sure of portraying fully the Emotional conditions of the
witnesses and the spectators, he reports, V. 54. "When they heard
these things, they were cut to the heart and they grabed on him
with their teeth; but he, Stephen, being full of the Holy Ghost
looked up steadfastly into heaven and saw the glory of God and
Jesus standing at the right hand of God, and said, Behold I
see the heavens opened, and the son of man standing on the
right hand of God. Then they cried out with a loud voice, and
stopped their ears and ran upon him with one accord, and cast
him out of the City and stoned him, and the witnesses laid down
their clothes at a young man's feet whose name was Saul."
</p>
<p>
This Saul, now Paul, must have acted as overseer or umpire.
Paul, is by chronologers reckoned to have been about 12 years
of age; But it will be seen that Luke, the narrator, is just such a
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'superservicable'">superserviceable</ins>
witness as wholly impairs his credibility. He says first,
Stephen was in fact filled with the Holy Ghost, saw the glory of
God, for he evidently was gloriable, and Jesus standing on the
right hand of God; and that in addition thereto he states that
Stephen, said he saw the same wonders&mdash;with the addition that
the heavens were opened, &amp;c. If he had been cross-examined and
asked whether little Paul, did not behold all these wonders, he
no doubt would have answered in the affirmative and volunteered
the statement, That they all saw these wonders, the high priest,
the accusers, by-standers, and human canines that gnashed their
teeth upon Stephen. Consult any author on Psychology on the
subject of Emotions, Exstatic illusions, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
But in the assembly inquisitors of Stephen, Paul and others
before the high priests, what special law or cannons were they
accused of violating? Answer, one cannon is quite conspicuous, to
wit:&mdash;Ex. 22:28. "Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the
ruler of the people."
</p>
<p>
When the inquisitor the high priest found the accused guilty,
he was delivered over to the witnesses for execution. The detectives
enjoyed the luxury of doing the stoning. If Christ's limitation had
been in use, to wit:&mdash;that none but the guiltless should throw stones,
the accusing sleuths might have been less zealous.&mdash;Ed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_10" id="Footnote_8_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_10"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Another question that here presents itself is&mdash;How could it
have happened that, Jerusalem being under one government, and
Damascus under another (if so the case was), the will of the local
rulers at Jerusalem found obedience, as it were of course, at the
hands of the adequate authorities at Damascus? To the question
how this <i>actually</i> happened, it were too much to undertake to give
an answer. For an answer to the question how it may be <i>conceived</i>
to have happened, reference may be made to existing English
practice. The warrant issued by the constituted authorities in
Jerusalem expected to find, and found accordingly in Damascus,
an adequate authority disposed to back it. In whatsoever Gentile
countries Jews, in a number sufficient to compose a synagogue,
established themselves, a habit naturally enough took place, as of
course, among them&mdash;the habit of paying obedience, to a considerable
extent, to the functionaries who were regarded as rulers of
the synagogue. Few are or have been the conquered countries, in
which some share of subordinate power has not been left, as well
to the natives of the conquered nation as to any independent foreigners,
to whom, in numbers sufficient to constitute a sort of corporate
body, it happened from time to time to have become settlers. After
all, what must be confessed is&mdash;that, in all this there seems nothing
but what might readily enough have been conceived, without its having
been thus expressed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_11" id="Footnote_9_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_11"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> It is well known that this dogma of Original sin&mdash;a disease
that the human family enjoys by sad inheritance, Christ treated with
negligible indifference. He dealt with the problems of man in a
social state, as socially conditioned only. A human being conditioned
as isolated from neighbors, friends and society, he did not as he
scientifically could not deal with, He discoursed upon social duties,
however sublimely, N.B. Acts 18:15, "But if thy brother shall
offend against thee, go and rebuke him between thee and him
alone, If he shall hear thee thou hast gained thy brother. But
if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more,
that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be
established. And if he shall neglect to hear them then tell it unto
the church. And if he neglect to hear the church, let him be to
thee as the heathen and publican, Amen I say unto you, Whatsoever
you shall bind on earth, shall be bound also in heaven: and
whatsoever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed also in heaven."
</p>
<p>
Now without quibbling about the translation this scheme of social
arbitration contains the ultimate of justice, It contains the only
working hypothesis within any social condition of mankind. There
is no such thing as justice in the abstract or concrete, It is like
heat and electricity, a mere mode of motion, a form of action. And
when a controversy between Citizens is fairly submitted to the
judgment of normal men the voice of their consciousness, being
the ultimate organ of nature's Creator, must be "binding" so far
as man is concerned socially.
</p>
<p>
And as there does not appear to the natural man any appeal to
heaven, the arbitrament of man in the special case carries the seal
of the eternities and forecloses all further controversy. The speech
of the honorable Consciousness of Man is the voice of the Creator
of his personality.&mdash;Ed.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3><i>Outward Conversion&mdash;how produced&mdash;how planned.</i></h3>

<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 1.</h4>

<h5>MOTIVE, TEMPORAL ADVANTAGE&mdash;PLAN.</h5>

<p>How flourishing the state of the church had at this
period become, will be seen more fully in another
place. Long before this period,&mdash;numbers of converts,
in Jerusalem alone, above three thousand. The
aggregate, of the property belonging to the individuals,
had been formed into one common fund: the
management&mdash;too great a burden for the united labours
of the eleven Apostles, with their new associate
Mathias&mdash;had, under the name so inappositely represented
at present by the English word <i>deacon</i>, been
committed to seven trustees; one of whom, Stephen,
had, at the instance of Paul, been made to pay, with
his life, for the imprudence, with which he had, in
the most public manner, indulged himself, in blaspheming
the idol of the Jews&mdash;their temple.<a name="FNanchor_13_15" id="FNanchor_13_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_15" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>
<p>Of that flourishing condition, Paul, under his original
name of Saul, had all along been a witness.
While carrying on against it that persecution, in
which, if not the original instigator, he had been
a most active instrument, persecuting, if he himself,
in what he is made to say, in Acts xxii. 4, is to be
believed,&mdash;"persecuting unto the death, binding and
delivering into prisons both men and women;"&mdash;while
thus occupied, he could not in the course of such
his disastrous employment, have failed to obtain a
considerable insight into the state of their worldly
affairs.</p>

<p>Samaria&mdash;the field of the exploits and renown of
the great sorcerer Simon, distinguished in those
times by the name of <i>Magus</i>&mdash;Samaria, the near
neighbour and constant rival, not to say enemy, of
Jerusalem;&mdash;is not more than about five and forty
miles distant from it. To Paul's alert and busy
mind,&mdash;the offer, made by the sorcerer, to purchase
of the Apostles a share in the government of the
church, could not have been a secret.</p>

<p>At the hands of those rulers of the Christian
Church, this offer had not found acceptance. Shares
in the direction of their affairs were not, like those
in the government of the British Empire in these
our days, objects of sale. The nine rulers would
not come into any such bargain; their disciples were
not as cattle in their eyes: by those disciples themselves
no such bargain would have been endured;
they were not as cattle in their own eyes.</p>

<p>But, though the bargain proposed by the sorcerer
did not take place, this evidence, which the offer of
it so clearly affords,&mdash;this evidence, of the value of
a situation of that sort in a commercial point of
view, could not naturally either have remained a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
secret to Paul, or failed to engage his attention, and
present to his avidity and ambition a ground of
speculation&mdash;an inviting field of enterprise.</p>

<p>From the time when he took that leading part, in
the condemnation and execution, of the too flamingly
zealous manager, of the temporal concerns of
the associated disciples of that disastrous orator, by
whom the preaching and spiritual functions might,
with so much happier an issue, have been left in
the hands of the Apostles&mdash;from that time, down to
that in which we find him, with letters in his pocket,
from the rulers of the Jews in their own country,
to the rulers of the same nation under the government
of the neighbouring state of Damascus, he
continued, according to the Acts ix. 1; "yet breathing
out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples
of the Lord."</p>

<p>Of these letters, the object was&mdash;the employing
the influence of the authorities from which they came,
viz. the High Priest and the Elders, to the purpose
of engaging those to whom they were addressed, to
enable him to bring in bonds, to Jerusalem from
Damascus, all such converts to the religion of Jesus,
as should have been found in the place last mentioned.</p>

<p>In his own person the author of the Acts informs
us&mdash;that, by Saul, letters to this effect were <i>desired</i><a name="FNanchor_14_16" id="FNanchor_14_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_16" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.
In a subsequent chapter, in the person of
Paul, viz. in the speech, to the multitude by whom
he had been dragged out of the Temple, in the design
of putting him to death, he informs us they were
actually <i>obtained</i><a name="FNanchor_15_17" id="FNanchor_15_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_17" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p><p>It was in the course of this his journey, and with
these letters in his pocket, that, in and by the vision
seen by him while on the road&mdash;at that time and not
earlier&mdash;his conversion was, according to his own
account of the matter, effected.</p>

<p>That which is thought to have been already proved,
let it, at least for argument's sake, be affirmed. Let
us say accordingly&mdash;this vision-story was a mere
fable. On this supposition, then, what will be to
be said of those same letters?&mdash;of the views in which
they were obtained?&mdash;of the use which was eventually
made of them?&mdash;of the purpose to which they were
applied? For all these questions one solution may
serve. From what is known beyond dispute&mdash;on the
one hand, of his former way of life and connections&mdash;on
the other hand, of his subsequent proceeding&mdash;an
answer, of the satisfactoriness of which the reader
will have to judge, may, without much expense of
thought, be collected.</p>

<p>If, in reality, no such vision was perceived by him,
no circumstance remains manifest whereby the
change which so manifestly and notoriously took
place in his plan of life, came to be referred to <i>that</i>
point in the field of time&mdash;in preference to any antecedent
one.</p>

<p>Supposing, then, the time of the change to have
been antecedent to the commencement of that journey
of his to Damascus&mdash;antecedent to the time of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the application, in compliance with which his letter
from the ruling powers at Jerusalem the object of
which was to place at his disposal the lot of the
Christians at Damascus, was obtained;&mdash;this supposed,
what, in the endeavour to obtain this letter,
was his object? Manifestly to place in his power
these same Christians: to place them in his power,
and thereby to obtain from them whatsoever assistance
was regarded by him as necessary for the
ulterior prosecution of his schemes, as above indicated.</p>

<p>On this supposition, in the event of their giving
him that assistance, which, in the shape of money
and other necessary shapes, he required&mdash;on this
supposition, he made known to them his determination,
not only to spare their persons, but to join
with them in their religion; and, by taking the lead
in it among the heathen, to whom he was, in several
respects, so much better qualified for communicating
it than any of the Apostles or their adherents, to
promote it to the utmost of his power. An offer of
this nature&mdash;was it in the nature of things that it
should be refused? Whatsoever was most dear to
them&mdash;their own personal security, and the sacred
interests of the new religion, the zeal of which was
yet flaming in their bosoms, concurred in pressing
it upon their acceptance.</p>

<p>With the assistance thus obtained, the plan was&mdash;to
become a declared convert to the religion of Jesus,
for the purpose of setting himself at the head of it;
and, by means of the expertness he had acquired in
the use of the Greek language, to preach, in the
name of Jesus, that sort of religion, by the preaching
of which, an empire over the minds of his converts,
and, by that means, the power and opulence
to which he aspired, might, with the fairest prospect
of success, be aimed at.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>But, towards the accomplishment of this design,
what presented itself as a necessary step, was&mdash;the
entering into a sort of <i>treaty</i>, and forming at least
in appearance, a sort of junction, with the leaders of
the new religion and their adherents&mdash;the Apostles
and the rest of the disciples. As for <i>them</i>, in acceding
to this proposal, on the supposition of anything
like sincerity and consistency on his part, <i>they</i> would
naturally see much to gain and nothing to lose: much
indeed to gain; no less than peace and security, instead
of that persecution, by which, with the exception
of the Apostles themselves, to all of whom
experience seems, without exception, to have imparted
the gift of prudence, the whole fraternity
had so lately been driven from their homes, and
scattered abroad in various directions.</p>

<p>With the Christians at Damascus, that projected
junction was actually effected by him: but, in this
state of things, to return to Jerusalem was not, at
that time, to be thought of. In the eyes of the ruling
powers, he would have been a trust-breaker&mdash;a traitor
to their cause: in the eyes of the Christians, he
would have been a murderer, with the blood of the
innocent still reeking on his hands: no one would he
have found so much as to lend an ear to his story,
much less to endure it. In Damascus, after making
his agreement with his new brethren, there remained
little for him to do. Much had he to inform himself
of concerning Jesus. Damascus&mdash;where Jesus had
already so many followers&mdash;Damascus was a place
for him to <i>learn</i> in: not to <i>teach</i> in:&mdash;at any rate, at
that time.</p>

<p>Arabia, a promising field of enterprise&mdash;Arabia, a
virgin soil, opened to his view. There he would find
none to abhor his person&mdash;none to contradict his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
assertions: there his eloquence&mdash;and, under the direction
of his judgment, his invention&mdash;would find
free scope: in that country the reproach of inconsistency
could not attach upon him: in that foreign
land he beheld his place of quarantine&mdash;his school
of probation&mdash;the scene of his novitiate. By a few
years employed in the exercise of his new calling&mdash;with
that spirit and activity which would accompany
him of course in every occupation to which he could
betake himself&mdash;he would initiate himself in, and
familiarize himself with, the connected exercises of
preaching and spiritual rule. At the end of that
period, whatsoever might be his success in that country,
such a portion of time, passed in innocence,
would at any rate allay enmity: such a portion of
time, manifestly passed, in the endeavour at any rate
to render service to the common cause, might even
establish confidence.</p>

<p>At the end of that time, he might, nor altogether
without hope of success, present himself to the rulers
of the church, in the metropolis of their spiritual
empire: "Behold, he might say, in me no longer a
persecutor, but a friend. The persecutor has long
vanished: he has given place to the friend. Too
true it is, that I was so once your persecutor. Years
spent in unison with you&mdash;years spent in the service
of the common cause&mdash;have proved me. You see
before you, a tried man&mdash;an ally of tried fidelity:
present me as such to your disciples: take me into
your councils: all my talent, all my faculties, shall be
yours. The land of Israel will continue, as it has
been, the field of <i>your</i> holy labours; the land of the
Gentiles shall be mine: we will carry on our operations
in concert; innumerable are the ways in which
each of us will derive from the other&mdash;information,
assistance, and support."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>To Arabia he accordingly repaired: so, in his
Epistle to the Galatians, Gal. i. 17, he himself informs
us: in that little-known country, he continued
three whole years&mdash;so also, in the same place, he
informs us. There it was, that he experienced that
success, whatever it was, that went to constitute the
ground, of the recommendation given of him by
Barnabas to the Apostles. From thence he returned
to Damascus: and, in that city, presenting himself
in his regenerated character, and having realized by
his subsequent conduct the expectations raised by
his promises at the outset of his career<a name="FNanchor_16_18" id="FNanchor_16_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_18" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>; he
planned, and as will be seen, executed his expedition
to Jerusalem: the expedition, the object of which
has just been brought to view. "Then," says Paul
himself, "I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and
abode with him fifteen days." Gal. 1:18. There,
says the author of the Acts, Acts 9:27, 28, "Barnabas
took him and brought him to the Apostles ...
and he was with them coming in and going out of
Jerusalem."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 2.</h4>

<h5>AT DAMASCUS, NO SUCH ANANIAS PROBABLY.</h5>

<p>This same Ananias&mdash;of whom so much has been
seen in the last chapter&mdash;Paul's own imagination excepted,
had he anywhere any existence? The probability
seems to be on the negative side: and, in the
next section, as to whether Paul's companions on
the road are not in a similar predicament, the reader
will have to judge. But let us begin with Ananias.</p>

<p>At Damascus, at any rate&mdash;with such power in his
hands, for securing obsequiousness at the hands of
those to whom he was addressing himself&mdash;with such
power in his hands, Paul could not have had much
need of anything in the shape of a vision:&mdash;he could
not have had any need of any such person as the seer
of the correspondent vision&mdash;Ananias.</p>

<p>For the purpose of aiding the operation of those
considerations of worldly prudence, which these
powers of his enabled him to present, to those whom
it concerned,&mdash;there might be some perhaps, who,
for yielding to those considerations, and thus putting
themselves under the command of this formidable
potentate, might look for an authority from the Lord
Jesus. But, forasmuch as, in this very case, even
at this time of day, visions, <i>two</i> in name, but, in
respect of probative force, reducible to <i>one</i>&mdash;are so
generally received as conclusive evidence,&mdash;no wonder
if, at that time of day, by persons so circumstanced,
that <i>one</i> vision should be received in that
same character. At Damascus, therefore, on his first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
arrival, there could not be any occasion for any such
corroborating story as the story of the vision of
Ananias. At Damascus&mdash;unless he had already obtained,
and instructed as his confederate, a man of
that name&mdash;no such story could, with any prospect
of success, have been circulated: for the purpose of
learning the particulars of an occurrence of such
high importance, the residence of this Ananias would
have been inquired after: and, by supposition, no
satisfactory answer being capable of being given to
any such inquiries,&mdash;no such story could be ventured
to be told.</p>

<p>Such was the case, at that place and at that time.
As to any such evidence, as that afforded by the
<i>principal</i> vision, viz. Paul's own,&mdash;perhaps no such
evidence was found necessary: but, if it <i>was</i> found
necessary, nothing could be easier than the furnishing
it. As to the <i>secondary</i> vision, viz. that ascribed
afterwards to a man of the name of Ananias,&mdash;at
that time scarcely could there have been any need
of it&mdash;any demand for it; and, had there been any
such demand, scarcely, unless previously provided,
could any such correspondent supply have been afforded.</p>

<p>In other places and posterior times alone, could
this supplemental vision, therefore, have been put
into circulation: accordingly, not till a great many
years after, was mention made of it by the author
of the Acts:&mdash;mention made by him, either in his
own person, or as having been related, or alluded to,
by Paul himself. Even the author of the Acts,&mdash;though
in this same chapter he has been relating
the story of Ananias's vision,&mdash;yet, when he comes
to speak, of the way, in which, according to him,
Paul, by means of his protector and benefactor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
Barnabas, obtained an introduction to the Apostles,
viz. all the Apostles, in which, however, he is so
pointedly contradicted by Paul himself,&mdash;yet speaks
not of Barnabas, as including, in the recommendatory
account he gave them, of Paul&mdash;his vision, and
his merits&mdash;any mention of this supplemental vision:&mdash;any
mention of any Ananias. Acts 9:27.</p>

<p>At Damascus, howsoever it might be in regard to
the Christians&mdash;neither to Jews, nor to Gentiles,
could the production, of any such letters as those
in question, have availed him anything. Such as
had embraced Christianity excepted, neither over
Gentiles nor over Jews did those letters give him any
power: and, as to Jews, the character in which&mdash;after
any declaration made of his conversion&mdash;he
would have presented himself, would have been no
better than that of an apostate, and betrayer of a
highly important public trust. To men of both these
descriptions, a plea of some sort or other, such as,
if believed, would be capable of accounting for so
extraordinary a step, as that he should change, from
the condition of a most cruel and inveterate persecutor
of the new religion, to that of a most zealous
supporter and leader,&mdash;could not, therefore, but be
altogether necessary. No sooner was he arrived at
Damascus, than, if the author of the Acts is to be
believed, he began pleading, with all his energy, the
cause of that religion, which, almost to that moment,
he had with so much cruelty opposed. As to the
story of his vision,&mdash;what is certain is&mdash;that, sooner
or later, for the purpose of rendering to men of all
descriptions a reason for a change so preeminently
extraordinary, he employed this story. But, forasmuch
as of no other account of it, as given by him,
is any trace to be found;&mdash;nor can any reason be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
found, why that which was certainly employed afterwards
might not as well be employed at and from
the first;&mdash;hence comes the probability, that from the
first it accordingly was employed.</p>

<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 3.</h4>

<h5>ON DAMASCUS JOURNEY&mdash;COMPANIONS NONE.</h5>

<p>In the preceding chapter, a question was started, but
no determinate answer as yet found for it: this is&mdash;what
became of the men, who&mdash;according to all the
accounts given by Paul, or from him, of his conversion
vision&mdash;were his <i>companions</i> in the journey?
At Damascus, if any such men there were, they would
in course arrive as well as he, and at the same time
with him. This circumstance considered, if any such
men there were,&mdash;and they were not in confederacy
with him,&mdash;the imposition must have been put upon
<i>them</i>: and, for that purpose, he must, in their presence,
have uttered the sort of discourse, and exhibited
the sort of deportment, mentioned in the above accounts.</p>

<p>To this difficulty, however, a very simple solution
presents itself. <i>He had no such companions.</i> Neither
by name, nor so much as by any the most general
description,&mdash;either of the persons, or of the total
number,&mdash;is any designation to be found anywhere:&mdash;not
in the account given in the Acts; not in any
account, given by himself, in any Epistle of his; or,
as from himself, in any part of the Acts. In the
company of divers others, a man was struck down,
he says, or it is said of him, by a supernatural light:
and, at the instant, and on the spot, has a conversation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
with somebody. Instead of saying who these
<i>other</i> men are, the credit of the whole story is left
to rest on the credit of this <i>one</i> man:&mdash;the credit,
of a story, the natural improbability of which, stood
so much need of collateral evidence, to render it
credible.</p>

<p>Not till many years had elapsed, after this journey
of his were these accounts, any one of them, made
public: and, in relation to these pretended companions&mdash;supposing
him interrogated at any time
posterior to the publication of the account in the
Acts,&mdash;after the lapse of such a number of years,
he could, without much difficulty, especially his situation
and personal character considered, hold himself
at full liberty, to remember or to forget, as much or
as little, as on each occasion he should find convenient.</p>

<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 4.</h4>

<h5>FLIGHT FROM DAMASCUS: CAUSES&mdash;FALSE&mdash;TRUE.</h5>

<h5>ACTS ix. 19-25.</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>And when he had received meat he was strengthened. Then was
Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus.&mdash;And
straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son
of God.&mdash;But all that heard him were amazed, and said: Is not this
he that destroyeth them which called on his name in Jerusalem;
and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound
unto the chief priests?&mdash;But Saul increased the more in strength, and
confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is
very Christ.&mdash;And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews
took counsel to kill him.&mdash;But their laying await was known of Saul.
And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.&mdash;Then the
disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a
basket.<br /><br /></p></div>

<p>The conception, which it was the evident design of
this passage to impress upon the mind of the reader,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
is&mdash;that, as soon almost as he was arrived at Damascus,
Paul not only went about preaching Jesus, but
preaching to that effect openly, and without reserve,
in all the synagogues: and that it was for this preaching,
and nothing else, that "the Jews," thus undiscriminating
is the appellation, purposely it should
seem, employed, "went about to kill him:" that thereupon
it was, that he made his escape over the wall,
and having so done, repaired immediately to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>In this conception, there seems to be evidently a
mixture of truth and falsehood.</p>

<p>That he addressed himself, in a greater or less
number, to the disciples,&mdash;must assuredly have been
true: to the accomplishment of his designs, as above
explained, intercourse with them could not but be
altogether necessary.</p>

<p>That, when any probable hope of favourable attention
and secrecy were pointed out to him&mdash;that, in
here and there an instance, he ventured so far as
to address himself to this or that individual, who
was not as yet enlisted in the number of disciples,&mdash;may
also have been true: and, for this purpose, he
might have ventured perhaps to show himself in
some comparatively obscure synagogue or synagogues.</p>

<p>But, as to his venturing himself so far as to preach
in all synagogues without distinction,&mdash;or in any
synagogue frequented by any of the constituted
authorities,&mdash;this seems altogether incredible.</p>

<p>To engage them to seek his life; to lie in wait to
kill him; in other words, to apprehend him for the
purpose of trying him, and probably at the upshot
killing him,&mdash;this is no more than, considering what,
in their eyes, he had been guilty of, was a thing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
course: a measure, called for&mdash;not, for preaching the
religion of Jesus; not, for any boldness in any other
way displayed; but, for the betraying of the trust,
reposed in him by the constituted authorities at
Jerusalem: thus protecting and cherishing those
malefactors, for such they had been pronounced by
authority, for the apprehending and punishing of
whom, he had solicited the commission he thereupon
betrayed. Independently of all other offence, given
by preaching or anything else,&mdash;in this there was
that, which, under any government whatever, would
have amply sufficed&mdash;would even more than sufficed&mdash;to
draw down, upon the head of the offender, a
most exemplary punishment.</p>

<p>In this view, note well the description, given in the
Acts, of the persons, by whose enmity he was driven
out of Damascus; compare with it what, in relation
to this same point, is declared&mdash;most explicitly declared&mdash;by
Paul himself.</p>

<p>By the account in the Acts, they were the persons
to whom he had been preaching Jesus; and who, by
that preaching, had been confounded and provoked.
Among those persons, a conspiracy was formed for
murdering him; and it was to save him from this
conspiracy that the disciples let him down the wall
in a basket.</p>

<p>Such is the colour, put upon the matter by the
author of the Acts. Now, what is the truth&mdash;the
manifest and necessary truth, as related&mdash;explicitly
related&mdash;by Paul himself? related, in the second of
his letters to his Corinthians, on an occasion when
the truth would be more to his purpose than the false
gloss put upon it by his adherents as above? The
peril, by which he was driven thus to make his escape,
was&mdash;not a murderous conspiracy, formed against
him by a set of individuals provoked by his preaching;&mdash;it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
was the intention, formed by the governor
of the city. Intention? to do what? to put him to
death against law? No; but to "<i>apprehend</i>" him.
To apprehend him? for what? Evidently for the
purpose of bringing him to justice in the regular
way&mdash;whatsoever was the regular way&mdash;for the offence
he had so recently committed: committed, by
betraying his trust, and entering into a confederacy
with the offenders, whom he had been commissioned,
and had engaged, to occupy himself, in concert with
the constituted authorities of the place, in bringing
to justice.</p>

<p>"In Damascus," says he, 2 Cor. xi. 32, 33, "the
governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the
Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend
me. And through a window in a basket was I let
down by the wall, and escaped his hands."</p>

<p>And on what <i>occasion</i> is it, that this account of the
matter is given by him? It is at the close of a declamation,
which occupies ten verses&mdash;a declamation,
the object of which is&mdash;to impress upon the minds of
his adherents the idea of his merits: viz. those which
consisted in labour, suffering, and perils: merits, on
which he places his title to the preference he claims
above the competitors to whom he alludes:&mdash;alludes,
though without naming them: they being, as he acknowledges
therein, ministers of Christ, and probably
enough, if not any of them Apostles, persons
commissioned by the Apostles. Greater, it is evident,
must have been the danger from the ruling
powers of the place, than from a set of individual
intended murderers:&mdash;from the power of the rulers
there could not be so much as a hope of salvation,
except by escape: from the individuals there would
be a naturally sufficient means of salvation; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
power of the rulers presenting a means of salvation,
and that naturally a sufficient one.</p>

<p>Note here, by the by, one of the many exemplifications,
of that confusion which reigns throughout in
Paul's discourses: the result, of that mixture, which,
in unascertainable proportions, seems to have had
place&mdash;that mixture of nature and artifice. It is at
the end of a long list of labours, sufferings, and
perils, that this anecdote presents itself. Was it
accordingly at the end of them that the fact itself
had taken place?&mdash;No: it was <i>at</i> the very commencement:
or rather, so far as concerned preaching, <i>before</i>
the commencement. Only in the way of allusion&mdash;allusion
in general terms&mdash;in terms of merely
general description, without mention of <i>time</i> or
<i>place</i>, or persons concerned,&mdash;are any of the other
sufferings or perils mentioned: in this instance alone,
is any mention made under any one of those heads:
and here we see it under two of them, viz. <i>place</i> and
<i>person</i>: and moreover, by other circumstances, the
<i>time</i>, viz. the <i>relative</i> time, is pretty effectually fixed.</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards, this same indisputably
false colouring will be seen laid on, when the account
comes to be given, of his departure for Jerusalem:
always for preaching Jesus is he sought after, never
for anything else.</p>

<p>According to this representation, here are two
governments&mdash;two municipal governments&mdash;one of
them, at the solicitation of a functionary of its own,
giving him a commission to negotiate with another,
for the purpose of obtaining, at his hands, an authority,
for apprehending a set of men, who, in the eyes
of both, were guilty of an offence against both. Instead
of pursuing his commission, and using his
endeavours to obtain the desired cooperation, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
betrays the trust reposed in him:&mdash;he not only
suffers the alleged malefactors to remain unapprehended
and untouched, but enters into a confederacy
with them. To both governments, this conduct of
his is, according to him, matter of such entire indifference,
that he might have presented himself
everywhere, as if nothing had happened, had it not
been for his preaching:&mdash;had it not been for his
standing forth <i>openly</i>, to preach to all that would
hear him, the very religion which he had been commissioned
to extinguish.</p>

<p>In such a state of things, is there anything that
can, by any supposition, be reconciled to the nature
of man, in any situation,&mdash;or to any form of government?</p>

<p>Three years having been passed by him in that to
him strange country, what, during all that time, were
his means of subsistence? To this question an unquestionable
answer will be afforded by the known
nature of his situation. He was bred to a trade,
indeed a handicraft trade&mdash;tent-making: an art, in
which the operations of the architect and the upholsterer
are combined. But, it was not to practise
either that, or any other manual operation, that he
paid his visit to that country. When he really did
practise it, he took care that this condescension of his
should not remain a secret: from that, as from everything
else he ever did or suffered, or pretended to
have done or suffered, he failed not to extract the
matter of glory for himself, as well as edification for
his readers. In Arabia, his means of subsistence
were not then derived from his trade: if they had
been, we should have known it:&mdash;from what source<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
then were they derived?<a name="FNanchor_17_19" id="FNanchor_17_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_19" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> By the very nature of
his situation, this question has been already answered:&mdash;from
the purses of those, whom, having
had it in his power, and even in his commission, to
destroy, he had saved.</p>

<p>And now, as to all those things, which, from the
relinquishment of his labours in the field of persecution
to the first of his four recorded visits to Jerusalem,
he is known to have done, answers have been
furnished:&mdash;answers, to the several questions <i>why</i>
and by what <i>means</i>, such as, upon the supposition
that the supernatural mode of his conversion was
but a fable, it will not, it is hoped, be easy to find
cause for objecting to as insufficient.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<h4>SECTION 5.</h4>

<h5>ARABIA-VISIT&mdash;MENTIONED BY PAUL, NOT ACTS.</h5>

<p>Not altogether without special reason, seems the veil
of obscurity to have been cast over this long interval.
In design, rather than accident, or heedlessness, or
want of information,&mdash;may be found, it should seem,
the cause, of a silence so pregnant with misrepresentation.
In addition to a length of time, more or
less considerable, spent in Damascus, a city in close
communication with Jerusalem, in giving proofs of
his conversion,&mdash;three years spent in some part or
other of the contiguous indeed, but wide-extending,
country of Arabia&mdash;(spent, if Paul is to be believed,
in preaching the religion of Jesus, and at any rate in
a state of peace and innoxiousness with relation to
it)&mdash;afforded such proof of a change of plan and
sentiment, as, in the case of many a man, might,
without miracle or wonder, have sufficed to form a
basis for the projected alliance:&mdash;this proof, even
of itself; much more, when corroborated, by the sort
of certificate, given to the Church by its preeminent
benefactor Barnabas, who, in introducing the new
convert, to the leaders among the Apostles, for the
special purpose of proposing the alliance,&mdash;took upon
himself the personal responsibility, so inseparably
involved in such a mark of confidence.</p>

<p>In this state of things then, which is expressly
asserted by Paul to have been, and appears indubitably
to have been, a real one,&mdash;considerations of
an ordinary nature being sufficient&mdash;to produce&mdash;not
only the effect actually produced&mdash;but, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
case of many a man, much more than the effect
actually produced,&mdash;there was no demand, at that
time, for a miracle: no demand for a miracle, for
any such purpose, as that of working, upon the minds
of the Apostles, to any such effect as that of their
maintaining, towards the new convert, a conduct free
from hostility, accompanied with a countenance of
outward amity. But, for other purposes, and in the
course of his intercourse with persons of other descriptions,
it became necessary for him to have had
these visions: it became necessary&mdash;not only for
the purpose of proving connection on his part with
the departed Jesus, to the satisfaction of all those
by whom such proof would be looked for,&mdash;but, for
the further purpose, of ascribing to Jesus, whatsoever
doctrines the prosecution of his design might
from time to time call upon him to promulgate;&mdash;those
doctrines, in a word, which, (as will be seen),
being his and not Jesus's&mdash;not reported by anyone
else as being Jesus's&mdash;we shall find him, notwithstanding,
preaching, and delivering,&mdash;so much at his
ease, and with unhesitating assurance.</p>

<p>A miracle having therefore been deemed necessary
(the miracle of the conversion-vision), and reported
accordingly,&mdash;thus it is, that, by the appearance of
suddenness, given to the sort and degree of confidence
thereupon reported as having been bestowed
upon him by the Apostles, a sort of confirmation is,
in the Acts account, given to the report of the miracle:
according to this account, it was not by the three
or four years passed by him in the prosecution of
their designs, or at least without obstruction given
to them;&mdash;it was not by any such proof of amity,
that the intercourse, such as it was, had been effected:&mdash;no:
it was by the report of the vision&mdash;that
report which, in the first instance, was made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
to them by their generous benefactor and powerful
supporter, Barnabas; confirmed, as, to every candid
eye it could not fail to be, by whatever accounts were,
on the occasion of the personal intercourse, delivered
from his own lips. "But Barnabas (says the
author) took him and brought him to the Apostles,
and declared unto them how he had <i>seen</i> the Lord
by the way, and that he had spoken to him, and
how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the
name of Jesus." Acts 9:27.</p>

<p>When in the year 57, Paul,<a name="FNanchor_18_20" id="FNanchor_18_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_20" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> to so many other
boastings, was added the sufferings he would have us
think were courted and endured by him, while preaching
in the name of Jesus, that gospel, which he proclaims
to have been his own, and not that of the
Apostles, little assuredly did he think, that five years
after, or thereabout, from the hand of one of his
own attendants, a narrative was to appear, in which,
of these same sufferings a so much shorter list would
be given; or that, by an odd enough coincidence, more
than seventeen centuries after, by a namesake of his
honored patron, Doctor Gamaliel, the contradiction
thus given to him, would be held up to view.</p>

<p>In the second of his epistles to his Corinthians,
dated A.D. 57,&mdash;the following is the summary he
gives of those same sufferings. Speaking of certain
unnamed persons, styled by him false Apostles, but
whom reasons are not wanting for believing to have
been among the disciples of the real ones,&mdash;"Are
they," says he, 2 Cor. xi. 23, "ministers of Christ?
I speak as one beside himself, I am more: in labours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
more abundant: in <i>stripes</i> above measure: in prisons
more frequent: in deaths, oft.&mdash;Of the Jews
five times received I forty stripes, save one.&mdash;Thrice
was I beaten with rods; once was I stoned:
thrice I suffered shipwreck: a night and a day have
I been in the deep." Thus far as per <i>Paul</i>.</p>

<p>Add from his former Epistle to the same in the
same year, battle with beasts, one. "If, after the
manner of men, I have fought with beasts at Ephesus,
what advantageth it me," continues he, 1 Cor.
<span class="smcap">XV</span>. 32, "if the dead rise not, let us eat and drink,
for tomorrow we die."</p>

<p>Let us now see how the account stands, as per <i>Acts</i>.
On the part of this his panegyrist, whether any such
habit had place as that of cutting down below their
real amount, either the sufferings or the actings of
his hero, the reader will have judged. Of both together,
let it not be forgotten, the Acts' account
comes some five years lower, than the date of the
above tragical list: in it are included those sufferings
and perils which we have seen, namely, those produced
by the voyage to Rome, and which, at the time
of Paul's list, had not taken their commencement.
Now then for the Acts' list. Stripes, nine-and-thirty
in a parcel, none: difference five. Beatings with
rods, saving one possible one, of which presently,
none; difference, three. Stoning, one<a name="FNanchor_19_21" id="FNanchor_19_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_21" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>. Shipwreck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
as yet none: the accident at Malta being three
years subsequent. "Night and day in the deep,"&mdash;according
as it was <i>on</i> or <i>in</i> the deep&mdash;either nothing
at all, or an adventure considerably too singular to
have been passed over. <i>Diving-bells</i> are not commonly
supposed to have been, at that time of day, in
use; but whoever has a taste for predictions, may,
if it be agreeable to him, see those same scientific
instruments or the equivalent in this Gospel of Paul's
predicted.</p>

<p>As to the parcels of stripes, the self-constituted
Apostle takes credit for, they would have been,&mdash;supposing
them administered,&mdash;administered, all of
them, according to law, meaning always the law of
<i>Moses</i>: for, it is in that law, (namely in Deuteronomy
<span class="smcap">XXV</span>. 3) that the clause, limiting to nine-and-thirty,
the number to be given at a time, is to be found. Of
these statements of Paul's, let it not pass unnoticed,
the place is&mdash;a formal and studied Epistle, not an
extempore speech: so that the falsehood in them, if
any, was not less deliberate than the Temple perjury.</p>

<p>Of all these same boasted bodily sufferings, eight
in the whole, when put together,&mdash;one was, at the
outset, reserved for consideration: let us see what
light, if any, is cast upon it by the Acts. One beating,
the Acts informs us of: and it was a beating by order
of magistrates: and accordingly, a beating according
to law. But the law, according to which it was
given, was not Jewish law: the magistrates, by whose
order it was given, were not Jewish magistrates.
The magistrates were heathens: and it was for being
Jews, and preaching in the Jewish style, that Paul,
and his companion Silas, were thus visited. It was
at Philippi that the affair happened: it was immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
preceded by their adventure with the divineress,
as per Acts 16:16; 34, Chap. 13: and brought
about by the resentment of her masters, to whose
established business, the innovation, introduced by
these interlopers, had given disturbance: it was followed&mdash;immediately
followed&mdash;by the earthquake,
which was so dexterous in taking irons off. Whether
therefore this beating was in Paul's account comprised
in the eight stripings and beatings, seems not
possible, humanly speaking, to know: not possible,
unless so it be, that Paul, being the wandering Jew,
we have sometimes heard of, is still alive,&mdash;still upon
the look-out, for that arial voyage, which, with or
without the expectation of an arostatic vehicle, we
have seen him so confident in the assurance of.</p>

<p>Remains the battle with the beasts. What these
same beasts were, how many there were of them,&mdash;how
many legs they respectively had&mdash;for example,
two or four&mdash;in what way he was introduced into
their company,&mdash;whence his difference with them
took its rise,&mdash;whether it was of his own seeking, or
by invitation that he entered the lists with these his
antagonists,&mdash;how it fared with <i>them</i> when the affair
was over,&mdash;(for as to the hero himself, it does not
appear that he was much the worse for it);&mdash;these,
amongst other questions, might be worth answering,
upon the supposition, that these antagonists of his
were real beings and real beasts, and not of the
same class as the arch-beast of his own begetting&mdash;Antichrist.
But, the plain truth seems to be, that if
ever he fought with beasts, it was in one of his
visions: in which case, for proof of the occurrence,
no visible mark of laceration could reasonably be
demanded. Meantime, to prove the negative, as far
as, in a case such as this, it is in the nature of a
negative to be proved,&mdash;we may, without much fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
of the result, venture to call his ever-devoted scribe.
To this same Ephesus,&mdash;not more than a twelvemonth
or thereabouts, before the date of the Epistle&mdash;he
brings his patron,&mdash;finds appropriate employment
for him,&mdash;and, off and on, keeps him there for
no inconsiderable length of time. There it is, that
we have seen, Chap. 13, . 7., his handkerchiefs
driving out devils as well as diseases: there it is, and
for no other reason than that <i>he</i> is there&mdash;there it is,
that we have seen so many thousand pounds worth
of magical books burnt&mdash;and by their owners: there
it is, that with a single handkerchief of his,&mdash;which
so it were but used, was an overmatch for we know
not how many devils,&mdash;we saw a single devil, with no
other hands than those of the man he lodged in,
wounding and stripping to the skin no fewer than
seven men at the same time. If, then, with or without
a whole skin at the conclusion of it, he had really
had any such rencounter, with one knows not how
many beasts, is it in the nature of the case, that
this same historiographer of his, should have kept us
ignorant of it? To be shut up with wild beasts,
until torn to pieces by them, was indeed one of the
punishments, for which men were indebted to the
ingenuity of the Roman lawyers: but, if any such
sentence was really executed upon our self-constituted
Apostle, his surviving it was a miracle too
brilliant not to have been placed at the head of all
his other miracles: at any rate, too extraordinary to
have been passed by altogether without notice. The
biographer of Daniel was not thus negligent.</p>

<p>After all, was it really matter of pure invention&mdash;this
same battle? or may it not, like so many of the
quasi-miracles in the Acts, have had a more or less
substantial foundation in fact? The case may it not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
have been&mdash;that, while he was at Ephesus, somebody
or other set a dog at him, as men will sometimes do
at a troublesome beggar? or that, whether with hand
or tongue, some person, male or female, set upon
him with a degree of vivacity, which, according to
Paul's zoology, elucidated by Paul's eloquence, entitled
him or her to a place in the order of beasts?&mdash;Where
darkness is thus visible, no light can be so
faint, as not to bring with it some title to indulgence.</p>

<p>Of the accounts, given us by the historiographer,
of the exploits and experiences of his hero while at
Ephesus, one article more will complete the list.
When any such opportunity offered, as that of presenting
him to view, in his here assumed character,
of a candidate for the honours of martyrdom,&mdash;was
it or was it not in the character of the historiographer
to let it pass unimproved? To our judgment on this
question, some further maturity may be given, by
one more law-case, now to be brought to view. Under
some such name as that of the <i>Ephesian Diana</i>,
not unfrequent are the allusions to it. <i>Church of
Diana silversmiths versus Paul and Co.</i> is a name,
by which, in an English law report, it might with
more strict propriety be designated. Plaintiffs,
silversmiths' company just named: Defendants, Paul
and Co.; to wit, said Paul, Alexander, Aristarchus,
Alexander and others. Acts, 22:41. Action on the
case for words:&mdash;the words, in tenor not reported:
purport, importing injury in the way of trade. Out
of the principal cause, we shall see growing a sort
of cross cause: a case of assault, in which three
of the defendants were, or might have been, plaintiffs:
cause of action, assault, terminating in false
imprisonment. In this exercetitious cause, defendants
not individually specified: for, in those early
days, note-taking had not arrived at the pitch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
perfection, at which we see it at present. That
which,&mdash;with reference to the question&mdash;as to the
truth of the beast-fighting story,&mdash;is more particularly
material in the two cases taken together,&mdash;is
this: in the situation, in which these junior partners
of Paul found themselves, there was some difficulty,
not to say some danger. Pressed, as he himself was
afterwards, in his invasion of Jerusalem,&mdash;pressed
in more senses than one, <i>they</i> found themselves by
an accusing multitude. What on this occasion does
Paul? He slips his neck out of the collar. So far
from lending them a hand for their support, he will
not so much as lend them a syllable of his eloquence.
Why? because forsooth, says his historiographer,
Acts xix. 30, 31, "the disciples suffered him not:"
<i>item</i>, v. 30, "certain" others of "his friends." When,
as we have seen him, spite of everything that could
be said to him, he repaired to Jerusalem on his
<i>Invasion Visit</i>,&mdash;he was not quite so perfectly under
the government of his friends. On the present occasion,
we shall find him sufficiently tractable. Was
this a man to be an antagonist and overmatch for
wild beasts?</p>

<p>Now as to the above-mentioned principal case.
Plaintiffs, dealers in silver goods: Defendants, dealers
in words. To be rivals in trade, it is not necessary
that men should deal exactly in the same articles:&mdash;the
sale of the words injured the sale of the
goods: so at least the plaintiffs took upon them to
aver: for, in such a case, suspicion is not apt to lie
asleep. The church of Diana was the Established
Church, of that place and time. To the honour, the
plaintiffs added the profit, of being silversmiths to
that same Excellent Church. To the value of that
sort of evidence, which it is the province of silversmiths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
to furnish, no established church was ever
insensible. The evidence, furnished by the church
silversmiths of these days, is composed of <i>chalices</i>:
under the Pagan dispensation, the evidence furnished
by the church silversmiths of the church of the
Ephesian Diana, was composed of <i>shrines</i>. When,
with that resurrection of his own, and that Gospel
of his own, of which so copious a sample remains
to us in his Epistles,&mdash;Paul, with or without the
name of Jesus in his mouth, made his appearance
in the market, Plaintiffs, as we have seen, took the
alarm. They proceeded, as the pious sons of an
established church could not fail to proceed. Before
action commenced, to prepare the way for a
suitable judgment,&mdash;they set to work, and set on fire
the inflammable part of the public mind. The church
was declared to be in danger, ver. 27: the church of
Diana, just as the church of England and Ireland
would be, should any such sacrilegious proposition
be seriously made, as that of tearing out of her
bosom any of those precious sinecures, of which
her vitals are composed. In Ephesus, it is not stated,
that, at that time, any society bearing the name of
the <i>Vice Society</i>, or the <i>Constitutional Association</i>,
was on foot. But, of those pious institutions the
equivalent could not be wanting. Accordingly, the
charge of <i>blasphemy</i>, it may be seen, ver. 37, was
not left unemployed. So the defence shows: the
defence, to wit, made by the probity and wisdom of
the judge: for, by the violence of the church mob,&mdash;who,
but for him, were prepared to have given a
precedent, to that which set Birmingham in flames,&mdash;the
defendants were placed in the condition of
prisoners: and the judge, seeing the violence, of the
prejudice they had to encounter, felt the necessity,
of adding to the function of judge, that of counsel
for the prisoners.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>But it is time to turn to the text: not a particle
of it can be spared.</p>


<h5>ACTS xix. 22-41.</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>22. So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto
him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a
season.&mdash;And the same time, there arose no small stir about that
way;&mdash;For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which
made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the
craftsmen;&mdash;Whom he called together with the workmen of like
occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our
wealth.&mdash;Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but
almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned
away much people, saying, that they be no gods, which are made
with hands:&mdash;So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set
at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana
should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom
all Asia and the world worshippeth.&mdash;And when they heard these
sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is
Diana of the Ephesians.&mdash;And the whole city was filled with confusion:
and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia,
Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord
into the theatre.&mdash;And when Paul would have entered in, unto the
people, the disciples suffered him not.&mdash;And certain of the chief
of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that
he would not adventure himself into the theatre.&mdash;Some, therefore,
cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused;
and the more part knew not wherefore they were come
together.&mdash;And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews
putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and
would have made his defence unto the people;&mdash;But when they
knew he was a Jew, all with one voice, about the space of two
hours, cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.&mdash;And when the
town clerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus,
what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the
Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the
image which fell down from Jupiter?&mdash;Seeing then that these things
cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing
rashly.&mdash;For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither
robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.&mdash;Wherefore,
if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies:
let them implead one another.&mdash;But if ye inquire anything concerning
other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.&mdash;For
we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar,
there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.&mdash;And
when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.</p></div>

<p>The <i>Judge</i> by whom the principal cause was tried,
and the plaintiffs non-suited, is styled, we see "<i>the
Town Clerk</i>:" the more appropriate and respected
title would not on this occasion have been ill-applied
to him. Except what we have here been seeing, we
know nothing of him that is <i>positive</i>: but, seeing
thus much of him, we see that he was an honest man:
and an honest man is not ill <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'pourtrayed'">portrayed</ins> by negatives.
He had no coronet playing before his eyes: no overpaid
places and sinecures for relatives. He had not
been made judge, for publishing a liturgy of the
church of Diana, with an embroidery composed of
his own comments,&mdash;or for circulating, with anonymous
delicacy, a pious warning, never to be absent
from the shrine of Diana, when the sacred cup was,
proffered by the hands of holy priests. Accordingly,
when the charge of <i>blasphemy</i> was brought
before him,&mdash;being a heathen, he found no difficulty
in treating it, in that gentle and soothing mode, in
which, when, from the bosom of an established church
it enters into a man, the spirit, which calls itself
the spirit of Christianity, renders him so averse to
the treating it. If, when his robes were off, he spoke
of Diana what we now think of her,&mdash;he did not,
when they were on, foam or rave, declare&mdash;that all,
who would not swear to their belief in her, were not
fit to be believed, or so much as fit to live.</p>

<p>By him, one man was not robbed of his rights,
because another man, when called upon as a witness,
refused to perjure himself. By him, a man was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
refused to be heard as a witness, nor refused protection
for the fruits of his industry, nor deprived
of the guardianship of his children, because he
waited to see Diana, before he declared himself a
believer in her existence. In the open theatre was
pronounced the judgment we have seen. He did not,
by secret sittings, deprive men of the protection of
the public eye. He did not, we may stand assured&mdash;for
we see how far the people of Ephesus were from
being tame enough to endure it&mdash;he did not keep
men's property in his hands, to be plundered by
himself, his children, or his creatures, till the property
was absorbed, and the proprietors sent broken-hearted
to their graves. He did not&mdash;for the people
of Ephesus <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'woud'">would</ins> not have endured it&mdash;wring out
of distress a princely income, on pretence of giving
decisions, declaring all the while his matchless incapacity
for everything but prating or raising doubts.
He did not display,&mdash;he could not have displayed&mdash;the
people of Ephesus <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'coud'">could</ins> not have endured it&mdash;any
such effrontery, as, when a judicatory was to sit
upon his conduct, to set himself down in it, and
assume and carry on the management of it. He
would not have sought impunity&mdash;for if he had
sought it in Ephesus, he would not have found it
there&mdash;he would not have sought impunity, in eyes
lifted up to heaven, or streaming with crocodile
tears.</p>

<p>Thus much as to his negative merits. But, we have
seen enough of him, to see one great positive one.
When, from the inexhaustible source of inflammation,
a flame was kindled,&mdash;he did not fan the flame,&mdash;he
quenched it.</p>

<p>The religion of Diana having thus come upon the
carpet, a reflection which could not be put by, is&mdash;spite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
of all efforts of the church silversmiths, in how
many essential points, negative as they are, the
religion of Diana had, on the ground of usefulness,
the advantage of that, which <i>is</i> the religion of Paul,
and <i>is called</i> the religion of Jesus. Diana drove no
men out of their senses, by pictures or preachments
of never-ending torments. On pretence of saving
men from future sufferings, no men were consigned
by it to present ones. No mischievous, no pain-producing,
no real vice, was promoted by it. It compelled
no perjury, no hypocrisy: it rewarded none.
It committed, it supported, it blessed, it lauded, no
depredation, no oppression in any shape: it plundered
no man of the fruits of his industry, under
the name of <i>tithes</i>. For the enrichment of the sacred
shrines,&mdash;money, in any quantity, we may venture to
say, received: received, yes: but in no quantity extorted.
One temple was sufficient for <i>that</i> goddess.
Believing, or not believing in her divinity,&mdash;no men
were compelled to pay money, for more temples,
more priests, or more shrines.</p>

<p><i>As to the religion of Jesus, true it is, that so long
as it continued the religion of Jesus, all was good
government, all was equality, all was harmony: free
church, the whole; established church, none: monarchy,
none; constitution, democratical. Constitutive
authority, the whole community: legislative, the
Apostles of Jesus</i>; executive, the Commissioners of
the Treasury: not Lords Commissioners, appointed
by a King Herod, but trustees or <i>stewards</i>; for such
should have been the word, and not <i>deacons</i>,&mdash;<i>agents
elected by universal suffrage</i>. In this felicitous state,
how long it continued&mdash;we know not. What we do
know, is&mdash;that, <i>in the fourth century</i>, <i>despotism</i> took
possession of it, and made an instrument of it. Becoming
<i>established</i>, it became noxious,&mdash;preponderantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
noxious. For, where <i>established</i> is the adjunct
to it, what does <i>religion</i> mean? what but <i>depredation</i>,
corruption, oppression, hypocrisy? <i>depredation</i>,
<i>corruption</i>, <i>oppression</i>, <i>hypocrisy</i>&mdash;these four:
with delusion, in all its forms and trappings, for
support.</p>

<p>So pregnant is this same boasting passage&mdash;1 Cor.
xv. 32, the labour it has thrown upon us, is not
altogether at an end. By what it says of the resurrection,
the memory has been led back, to what we
have seen on the same subject, in one of Paul's
Epistles to his Thessalonians: brought together, the
two doctrines present a contrast too curious to be
left unnoticed. Of the apparatus employed by him
in his trade of <i>disciple-catcher</i>, his talk about the
resurrection, was, it may well be imagined, a capital
article. Being, according to his own motto, <i>all things
to all men</i>, 1 Cor. ix. 22, whatever it happened to
him to say on the subject, was dished up, of course,
according to the taste of those he had to deal with.
To some it was a <i>prediction</i>: for such, we have seen,
was the form it assumed when the people to be
wrought upon were the Thessalonians. To others,
when occasion called, it was a statement concerning
something <i>past</i>, or supposed to be past. On an occasion
of this sort it was, that the name of Jesus,
another article of that same apparatus, was of so
much use to him. True it is, that to the doctrine of
the <i>general</i> resurrection in time future, he had, it
must be remembered, no need of declaring himself
beholden to Jesus: at least, if on this point, the
Acts' history is to be believed: for, of the Pharisees,&mdash;the
sect to which Paul belonged&mdash;of the Pharisees,
as compared with the other sect the Sadducees, it
was the distinctive tenet. But, of the then future,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
the then past, as exemplified in the <i>particular</i> case
of Jesus, could not but afford very impressive circumstantial
evidence. Of this momentous occurrence,
there were the real Apostles, ready to give
their accounts,&mdash;conformable, it may be presumed,
to those we see given, as from them, by the four
Evangelists. These accounts, however, would not
suit the purpose of the self-constituted Apostle: in
the first place, because they came from the real
Apostles, with whom, as we have so often seen, it
was a declared principle with him not to have had
anything to do: in the next place, because the Apostles
were too scrupulous: they would not have furnished
him with witnesses enough. His own inexhaustible
fund&mdash;his own invention,&mdash;was therefore
the fund, on this occasion, drawn upon: and, accordingly,
instead of the number of witnesses,&mdash;say <i>a
score</i> or two at the utmost&mdash;he could have got from
the Apostles,&mdash;it supplied him with <i>five hundred</i>:
five hundred, <i>all at once</i>: to which, if pressed, he
could have added any other number of percipient
witnesses whatsoever, provided only that it was at
<i>different</i> times they had been such.</p>

<p>So much for explanation: now for the announced
contrast. Whoever the people were, whom he had
to address himself to,&mdash;they had contracted, he
found, a bad habit: it was that of <i>eating and drinking</i>.
Reason is but too apt to be seduced by, and
enlisted in the service of her most dangerous enemy&mdash;<i>Appetite</i>.
Not only did they eat and drink; but
they had found, as it seemed to them, <i>reason</i> for so
doing. They ate and drank&mdash;why? because they were
to die after it. "Let us eat and drink," said the
language we have seen him reproaching them with,
1 Cor. xv. 32. "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow
we die."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>The case is&mdash;that, in pleasure, in whatever shape
they see her,&mdash;all men, to whose ambition supernatural
terrors supply an instrument of dominion, behold
their most formidable rival. Against such a
rival, wonderful indeed it would be, if their hostility
were not proportionable. No morality accordingly
do they acknowledge, that does not include, with
or without other things, hatred,&mdash;with or without
contempt, of pleasure. Such, too, as is their morality,
such is their law. Death is scarce severe enough,
for a pleasure, which they either have, or would be
thought to have, no relish for. So at least says what
they teach: but, teaching how to act is one thing;
acting accordingly, another. Thus we all see it is,
in so many instances: and thus, without much danger
of injustice, we may venture to suppose it may have
been, in that of the self-constituted Apostle.</p>

<p>Not so Jesus: no harm did he see in eating and
drinking, unless with the pleasure it produced
greater pain. With this reserve, no harm,&mdash;for anything
that appears in any one of the four histories
we have of him,&mdash;no harm did he see in anything
that gives pleasure. What every man knows&mdash;and
what Jesus knew as well as any man&mdash;for neither
in words nor in acts did he deny it&mdash;is,&mdash;that happiness,
at what time soever experienced,&mdash;happiness,
to be anything, must be composed of pleasures: and,
be the man who he may, of what it is that gives
pleasure to him, he alone can be judge.</p>

<p>But, to return to eating and drinking. Eating and
drinking&mdash;he gives his men to understand&mdash;even he,
holy as he is, should not have had any objection to,
had it not been for this same resurrection of his,
which he was telling them of: eating and drinking&mdash;a
practice, to which, notwithstanding this resurrection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
of his, and so much as he had told them of it, he
had the mortification to find them so much addicted.
So much for his <i>Corinthians</i>. It was, as we see, <i>for
want</i> of their paying, to what he was thus telling
them about the resurrection, that attention, to which
it was so well entitled,&mdash;that <i>they</i> still kept on in
that bad habit. But his <i>Thessalonians</i>&mdash;they too, as
we have seen, had got the same bad habit. Well:
and what was it that gave it them? What but their
paying too much attention to this same resurrection
of his, dished up in the same or another manner, by
the same inventive and experienced hand. In conclusion,
on laying the two cases together, what seems
evident enough is&mdash;that, in whatever manner served
up to them, his resurrection, whatever it was, was
considerably more effectual in making people eat
and drink, than in weaning them from it.</p>

<h4>SECTION 6.</h4>

<h5>GAMALIEL&mdash;HAD HE PART IN PAUL'S PLAN?</h5>

<p>Gamaliel&mdash;in the working of this conversion, may
it not be that Gamaliel&mdash;a person whose reality seems
little exposed to doubt&mdash;had rather a more considerable
share, than the above-mentioned unknown and
unknowable Ananias?</p>

<p>Gamaliel was "a doctor of law" Acts 5:34&mdash;a person
of sufficient note, to have been a member of the
council, in which the chief priests, under the presidency
of the High Priest, Acts 5:24, took cognizance
of the offence with which Peter and his associates
had a little before this been charged, on the occasion
of their preaching Jesus. Under this Gamaliel, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
Paul, he so at least is made to tell us, studied, Acts
22:3. Between Paul and this Gamaliel, here then
is a connection: a connection&mdash;of that sort, which,
in all places, at all times, has existence,&mdash;and of
which the nature is everywhere and at all times so
well understood&mdash;the connection between <i>proteg</i>
and protector. It was by authority from the governing
body, that Paul was, at this time, lavishing his
exertions in the persecution of the Apostles and their
adherents:&mdash;who then so likely, as this same Gamaliel,
to have been the patron, at whose recommendation
the commission was obtained? Of the cognizance
which this Gamaliel took, of the conduct and
mode of life of the religionists in question,&mdash;the result
was favourable. "Let them alone," were his
words. Acts v. 38. The maintenance, derived by the
<i>proteg</i>, on that same occasion, from the persecution
of these innoxious men&mdash;this maintenance being at
once odious, dangerous, and precarious,&mdash;while the
maintenance, derivable from the taking a part in the
direction of their affairs, presented to view a promise
of being at once respectable, lucrative, and permanent;&mdash;what
more natural then, that this change,
from left to right, had for its origin the advice of
this same patron?&mdash;advice, to which, all things considered,
the epithet <i>good</i> could not very easily be
refused.</p>


<h5>FALSE PRETENCES EMPLOYED.</h5>

<p>To the self-constituted Apostle, false pretences were
familiar. They were not&mdash;they could not have been&mdash;without
an object. One object was power: this
object, when pursued, is of itself abundantly sufficient
to call forth such means. But, another object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
with Paul was money: of its being so, the passages
referred to as above, will afford abundant proofs.
A man, in whose composition the appetite for money,
and the habit of using false pretences are conjoined,
will be still more likely to apply them to that productive
purpose, than to any barren one. In the
character of a general argument, the observations
thus submitted, are not, it should seem, much exposed
to controversy.</p>

<p>But, of a particular instance, of money obtained
by him on a false pretence,&mdash;namely, by the pretence
of its being for the use of others, when his intention
was to convert it to his own use,&mdash;a mass of evidence
we have, which presents itself as being in no slight
degree probative. It is composed of two several
declarations of his own,&mdash;with, as above referred to,
the explanation of it, afforded by a body of circumstantial
evidence, which has already been under review:
and as, in the nature of the case, from an evil-doer
of this sort, evidence to a fact of this sort, cannot
reasonably be expected to be frequently observable,&mdash;the
labour, employed in bringing it here to
view, will not, it is presumed, be chargeable, with
being employed altogether without fruit.</p>

<p>First, let us see a passage, in the first of his
Epistles to his <i>Corinthians</i>, date of it, A.D. 57. In
this, we shall see a regularly formed system of
money-gathering: an extensive application of it to
various and mutually distant countries, with indication
given of particular times and places, in which
it was his intention to pursue it: also, intimation, of
a special charitable purpose, to which it was his
professed intention to make application of the produce
of it, at a place specified: namely, Jerusalem.</p>

<p>First then comes, 1 Cor. 16:1-8. A.D. 57.</p>

<p>"Now concerning the collection for the saints, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
I have given order to the churches of <i>Galatia</i>, even
so do <i>ye</i>.&mdash;Upon the <i>first day of the week</i>, let every
one of you <i>lay by him in store</i>, as God hath prospered
him, that there be no gatherings when I come.&mdash;And
when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve
by your letters, them will I send to bring your
liberality unto <i>Jerusalem</i>.&mdash;And if it be meet that
I go also, they shall go with me.&mdash;Now I will come
unto you when I shall pass through Macedonia;
for I do pass through <i>Macedonia</i>.&mdash;And it may be
that I will abide, yea and winter with you, that ye
may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.&mdash;For
I will not see you now by the way: but I trust
to tarry a while with <i>you</i> if the Lord permit.&mdash;But
I will tarry at <i>Ephesus</i> until Pentecost." At
Ephesus, where he becomes an object of jealousy, as
we have seen, to the church-silversmiths; and, from
his declared business at those <i>other</i> places, some evidence
surely is afforded of what was his probable
business in <i>that</i> place.</p>

<p>Next let us see a passage in his Epistle to his
<i>Romans</i>: date of it, A.D. 58. Here, in two instances,
we shall see the success, with which this system was
pursued by him: as also a maxim, laid down by him&mdash;a
maxim, in which the existence of this same system,
on his part, is acknowledged: a maxim, in which his
hopes of success in the pursuit of it, are declaredly
founded.</p>

<p>Rom. 15:24-28. A.D. 58.</p>

<p>"Whensoever I take my journey into <i>Spain</i>, I will
come to you; for I trust to see you in my journey,
and to be brought on my way thitherward by you,
if first I be somewhat filled with your company.&mdash;But
now I go unto <i>Jerusalem, to minister unto the
Saints</i>.&mdash;For it hath pleased them of <i>Macedonia</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
and <i>Achaia to make a certain contribution for the
poor saints which are at Jerusalem</i>.&mdash;It hath
pleased them verily: and their debtors they are.
For if the Gentiles have been made <i>partakers of
their spiritual things</i>, their <i>duty</i> is also <i>to minister
unto them in carnal things</i>.&mdash;When therefore I have
performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit,
I will come <i>by you</i> into <i>Spain</i>."</p>

<p>In the instance in question, money (we see)&mdash;of
the quantity of course nothing said&mdash;is mentioned by
him, as being actually in his hands: the purpose, for
which it was there,&mdash;and to which he would of course
be understood to intend applying it,&mdash;being also mentioned
by him:&mdash;applying it, at Jerusalem, to the use
of the poor saints. So much for <i>professed</i> intentions.
Now then for <i>real</i> ones. Answer, in his own
words: that those Gentiles, who by him had been
made partakers of his spiritual things, might, as in
"<i>duty</i>" bound, "minister" to him, so much the more
effectively "in carnal things:" that he, who preached,
what he called the Gospel, might, as he had been
preaching to his Corinthians also (1 Cor. ix. 14) be
enabled so much the more comfortably to "live by"
it.</p>

<p>"The poor saints which are at Jerusalem:"&mdash;<i>the</i>
poor saints&mdash;to wit, not here and there a saint or two,
but the whole Christian population living together on
a common stock&mdash;if now, A.D. 58, they were living,
as A.D. 53 they were (Acts ii. 44; vi. 1) and, in this
particular, from the beginning to the end of the history,
no change is mentioned&mdash;in Jerusalem&mdash;was it
in the nature of man, in that state of men and things,&mdash;was
it in the nature of men and things, that any
man, who had any knowledge of their situation, and
of the terms on which Paul, from first to last, had
been with them, could for a moment have thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
lodging, for <i>their</i> use, any the smallest sum of money
in <i>his</i> hands? as well might it be said, at this moment&mdash;a
man, whose wish it was to convey money to
Spain, for the use of the Cortes, would choose the
hand of the Duc d'Angouleme to send it by. All this
time, <i>there</i> were the Apostles of Jesus&mdash;patrons of
those same saints: and, anywhere more easily than
<i>there</i>, could he be. That, with this money in his hands,
among his objects was&mdash;the employing more or less
of it in the endeavour to form a party there, may
not unreasonably be supposed, from what we have
seen of that <i>Invasion Visit</i>, by which his designs
upon Jerusalem were endeavoured to be carried into
effect. For, according to Acts 19:21, already when
he was at Ephesus, as above, was it his known design,
to try his fortune once more in Jerusalem, and after
that in Rome. This may have been among his designs,
or not. Be this as it may, this would have been
no more than a particular way, of converting the
money to his own use.</p>

<p>Not that, if at this time, and for <i>this purpose</i> from
even the quarters in question, money had come, as
he says it had, there was anything very wonderful
in its so doing. As to <i>us</i> indeed <i>we</i> know pretty well
what sort of terms he was on, from first to last, with
the community in question: <i>we</i> know this, because his
historiographer has made us know it. But, as to the
people of those same countries respectively,&mdash;at their
distance from Jerusalem, what, in their situation,
might easily enough happen was,&mdash;not to have, as to
this point, any adequate information till it was too
late to profit by it: and, that such would be their
ignorance, is a matter, of which he might not less
easily have that which, to a man of his daring and
sanguine temper, would be a sufficient assurance.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>One thing there is, which, on the occasion of any
view they took of this subject, may perhaps have
contributed to blind their eyes. This is&mdash;the fact,
of his having actually been concerned, in bringing
money to Jerusalem, for a similar purpose, though
it must be confessed, not less than fourteen years
before this: to wit, from Antioch, as stated in Chapter
V., speaking of <i>that</i>&mdash;his second Jerusalem Visit,
by the name of the <i>Money-bringing Visit</i>.</p>

<p>But,&mdash;what may easily enough have happened,
distance in time and place, together considered, is&mdash;that
to those particulars, which composed no more
than the surface of the business, <i>their</i> knowledge was
confined: while <i>we</i>, though at the distance of more
than seventeen centuries, know more or less of the
inside of it,&mdash;let into it, as we have been, by the
author of the Acts.</p>

<p>As to their arriving sooner or later, at the suspicion,
or though it were the discovery, that the money
had not, any part of it, reached the hands it was
intended for, nor was in any way to do so,&mdash;what bar
could the apprehension of any such result oppose, to
the enterprise, systematic, as we see it was, of the
creator of Antichrist? When, to a man, who occupies
a certain situation in the eye of the political world,
calls for accounts are become troublesome,&mdash;Scipio
might have informed him, if he had not well enough
known of himself, how to answer them.</p>

<p>When a charge made upon you is true&mdash;evidence
full against you, and none to oppose to it,&mdash;fly into
a passion, magnify your own excellence&mdash;magnify
the depravity of your adversaries. This mode, of
parrying a charge, is perfectly well understood in our
days, nor could it have been much less well understood
in Paul's days. As for <i>his</i> adversaries, Paul
had a storm <i>in petto</i> at all times ready for them:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
for the materials, turn to any page of his Epistles:
whatever, in this way, he had for rivals,&mdash;<i>that</i> and
more he could not fail to have for accusing witnesses.
To the creator of Antichrist&mdash;sower of tares between
Pharisees and Sadducees,&mdash;whatever were the
charges, defence, the most triumphant, could never
be wanting: arguments, suited with the utmost
nicety, to the taste of judges. He would warn them,
against false brethren, and liars, and wolves, and
children of Satan, and so forth: he would talk to
them, about life and death, and sin and righteousness,
and faith and repentance, and this world and that
world, and the Lord and resurrection: he would talk
backwards and forwards&mdash;give nonsense for mystery,
and terror for instruction: he would contradict
everybody, and himself not less than anybody: he
would raise such a cloud of words, with here and
there an <i>ignis fatuus</i> dancing in the smoke,&mdash;that
the judges, confounded and bewildered, would forget
all the evidence, and cry out <i>Not Guilty</i> through
pure lassitude.</p>

<p>As to us,&mdash;the case being now before us, what
shall be our verdict? Obtaining money on false
pretences is the charge. Guilty shall we say, or not
guilty? Obtainment on a certain pretence, is proved
by <i>direct</i> evidence&mdash;his own evidence: proof, of
falsity in the pretence, rests, as it could not but rest,
on <i>circumstantial</i> evidence.</p>

<p>One observation more: for another piece of circumstantial
evidence has just presented itself: it consists
of the utter silence, about the receipt of the
money or any particle of it,&mdash;when, if there had been
any such receipt, occasions there were in such abundance
for the mention of it. A.D. 57, in his first to
his Corinthians,&mdash;there it is, as we have seen, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
he urges them to lay by money for him, declaring it
is for the saints at Jerusalem; and that on this same
errand it is, that he is going to Macedonia,&mdash;and that
in his way to Jerusalem he will give them another
call, to receive, for that same purpose, the intermediate
produce of these proposed <i>saving-banks</i>. In
his letter to the Romans, written the next year, A.D.
58&mdash;written at Corinth,&mdash;then it is, that he has already
made the said intended money-gathering visit,
and with success:&mdash;with success not only in Macedonia,
as he had proposed, but in Achaia likewise:
and, with this money in his hand, and for the purpose
of delivering the money to those for whom he obtained
it;&mdash;for this purpose (he says) it is, that he
is at that moment on his way to Jerusalem&mdash;the
place of their abode. This is in the year A.D. 58.
Well then: after this it is, that he takes up his abode
at Ephesus. And when, after his contests with the
church silversmiths there, he departs from thence,
whither does he betake himself? To Jerusalem?
No: he turns his back upon Jerusalem, and goes for
Macedonia (Acts xx. 1.) then into Greece, where he
stays three months; and purposes, Acts 20:3, to
return through Macedonia. A.D. 60, it is, that, for
the first time, Acts 20:16, any intention of his to
visit Jerusalem is declared, he having coveted no
man's silver or gold, as his historian, Acts xx. 33,
makes him assure us. When, at length he arrived
there, what his reception was, we have seen. Had
any of the <i>money</i> been received there, would such
as we have seen have been the reception given to
the <i>man</i>? When, by the Christians at Jerusalem,
Agabus was sent to him, to keep him if possible from
coming there,&mdash;is it in the nature of things, that
they should have already received any of it, or been
in any expectation of it? In what passed between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
him and the Elders, headed by the Apostle James,
is any the slightest allusion made to it? When, in
Csarea, all in tears, Acts 21:12, 13, his attendants
were striving, might and main, to dissuade him from
going to Jerusalem,&mdash;did he say anything about the
money&mdash;the money he had been so long charged
with? Oh no; not a syllable: to Jerusalem he is
resolved to go indeed: Oh yes: but not the shadow
of a reason can he find for going there.</p>

<p>When arrived at Jerusalem, the brethren, says the
Acts 20:17, received him gladly. The brethren: yes,
what adherents he had, would of course receive him
gladly, or at least appear to do so. But the money?
On their side, was anything said about the money?
Not a syllable. Either at this time by his own hand,
or any time before, by other hands, had they received
this money, or any considerable part of it,
could they have received him otherwise than not only
gladly, but gratefully?</p>

<p>All the time, the hero was thus employed in money-craving
and money-gathering, the historian, let it
never be out of mind, was of the party: four years
before, A.D. 53, had he been taken into it; yet not
any the least hint about these money-matters does
he give. So far indeed as regarded what was avowedly
for Paul's own use, neither could the receipt nor
the craving of the money from their customers, have
been unknown to him; for this was what they had to
live upon. But the letters his master wrote&mdash;wrote
to their customers everywhere&mdash;letters, in which the
demand was made, for the so much more extensive
purpose,&mdash;of these, so many of which have reached
these our times, the contents may to him have easily
enough remained a secret: little reason had he to
expect, none at all to fear, the exposure,&mdash;which now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
at the end of more than seventeen centuries, has, at
length, been made of them,&mdash;confronted, as they may
now be, with the particulars he himself has furnished
us with.</p>

<p>
When ever we get a Temperamental and psychological view of
Paul, we see verified the deductions of the author of this treatise,
that he was a transparent imposter. An unscrupulous adventurer.
With talent well adapted to dogmatically command the attention of
the ignorant and especially those of organized hereditary idolatry,
the extreme vanity, the vain glorious pretensions of this new priest
was well adapted to obtain obsequious complacence from such
people. He always presents himself in a controversial spirit of self-exaltation.
</p>
<p>
His egotistic diction could hardly be made more manifest than
in the terms above quoted, to wit:&mdash;"I robbed other Churches taking
wages of them that I might minister unto you, &amp;c." It presents a
striking contrast to the benevolent and fraternal spirit of Christ and
his disciples.</p></div>

when this martyrdom had been suffered by him,&mdash;"some" says Acts
xiv. 19, were "supposing he had been dead:" and on that supposition,
"drew him out of the city." Paul, on the other hand, thought
otherwise: he supposed himself alive, and, on that supposition, he
walked off, as if nothing had been the matter with him. "Certain
Jews ... say verses 19 and 20, having stoned Paul, drew him out
of the city, supposing he had been dead. Howbeit, as the disciples
stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the
next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe."</p></div></div>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3><i>Paul disbelieved.&mdash;Neither his divine Commission
nor his inward Conversion ever credited by the
Apostles or their Jerusalem Disciples.&mdash;Source
of Proof stated.</i>
</h3>

<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 1.</h4>

<h5>TO PAUL'S CONVERSION VISION, SOLE ORIGINAL
WITNESS HIMSELF.</h5>

<p>Void, as we have seen, of all title to credence, is the
story of Paul's commission from Jesus:&mdash;void may
it be seen to be, even if taken by itself, and without
need of resort to any counter-evidence. Who could
have expected to have found it, moreover, disproved
by the most irresistible counter-evidence&mdash;by the
evidence of the Apostles themselves? Yes: of the
Apostles themselves, of whom it will plainly enough
be seen, that by not so much as one of them was it
ever believed: no, not to even the very latest period,
of which any account has reached us: namely that,
at which the history of the Acts of the Apostles
closes, or that of the date of the last-written of
Paul's Epistles, whichsoever of the two may be the
latest.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>In regard to the story of his conversion, its cause,
and manner,&mdash;it has been seen, that it is either from
himself directly, or from an adherent of his, the
author of the Acts,&mdash;who had it from himself, unless
Ananias was a person known to the author of the
Acts, and heard by him,&mdash;it is from Paul, and Paul
alone, that all the evidence, which the case has happened
to supply, has been derived.</p>

<p>In regard to the degree of credence given, to his
pretence to the having received a commission from
Jesus, still the same remark applies: still, either from
himself, or from the same partial, and, as will be
seen, not altogether trustworthy, narrator, comes the
whole of the evidence, with which the case happens
to have furnished us.</p>

<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 2.</h4>

<h5>COUNTER-WITNESSES, THE APOSTLES. BY THEM, THE
STORY WAS PROBABLY NOT HEARD&mdash;CERTAINLY NOT
CREDITED.</h5>

<p>Jerusalem, according to the Acts, was the headquarters
of the noble army of the Apostles: the
ordinary residence of that goodly fellowship:&mdash;a
station, which they none of them ever quitted, for
any considerable length of time.</p>

<p>In the course of the interval, between the date
assigned by Paul to his conversion, and that of the
last particulars we have of his history,&mdash;mention,
more or less particular, may be found of four visits
of his&mdash;distinctly four related visits, and no more
than four,&mdash;to that metropolis of the new Church.
On no one of these occasions, could he have avoided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
using his endeavours, towards procuring admittance,
to the fellowship of the distinguished persons, so
universally known in the character of the select companions
and most confidential servants of Jesus: of
that Jesus, whom, in the flesh at any rate, he never
so much as pretended to have ever seen: <i>from whom</i>
he had consequently, if they thought proper to impart
it, so much to learn, or at least to wish to learn:
while <i>to</i> them he had nothing to impart, except that
which, if anything, it was only in the way of <i>vision</i>,
if in any way, that he had learned from Jesus.</p>

<p>That on three at least of these four occasions, viz.
the 1st, 3d, and 4th, he accordingly did use his endeavours
to confer with them, will be put out of
dispute by direct evidence; and that, in the remaining
one, namely that which in the order of time stands
second,&mdash;successfully or not, his endeavours were
directed to the same purpose,&mdash;will, it will be seen,
be reasonably to be inferred from circumstantial
evidence. In the character of an additional occasion
of intercourse, between him and one of the Apostles,
namely, Peter, the chief of them,&mdash;will be to be added,
that which will be seen taking place at Antioch;
immediately upon the back, and in consequence, of
the third of these same visits of his to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>As to the mode of his conversion as above stated,&mdash;the
<i>time</i>, for him to have stated it to them, was manifestly
that of the first of these four visits;&mdash;say his
<i>reconciliation-visit</i>: and that, of that first visit, to
see them, or at any rate the chief of them, namely,
Peter, was the object,&mdash;is what, in his Epistle to the
Galatians, we shall see him declaring in express
terms.</p>

<p>After all&mdash;that story of his, in which the supposed
manner of his conversion is related, as above,&mdash;did
he so much as venture to submit it to them? The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
more closely it is examined, the less probable surely
will be seen to be&mdash;his having ventured, to submit
any such narrative, to a scrutiny so jealous, as theirs,
under these circumstances, could not fail to be.</p>

<p>One of two things at any rate will, it is believed,
be seen to a certainty: namely, Either no such story
as that which we see, nor anything like it, was ever
told to them by him; or, if yes, it obtained no credit
at their hands.</p>

<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 3.</h4>

<h5>IN PROOF OF THIS, SO MUCH OF THE ACTS HISTORY
MUST HERE BE ANTICIPATED.</h5>

<p>For proof, of the disbelief, which his story will, it is
believed, be found to have experienced, at the hands
of those supremely competent judges,&mdash;the time is
now come, for collecting together, and submitting in
a confronted state to the reader, all the several
particulars that have reached us, in relation to these
four important visits.</p>

<p>Between the first-recorded and the last-recorded
of the four, the length of the interval being so considerable
as it will be seen to be, namely, upwards
of 17 years at the least,&mdash;and, in the course of the
interval, so numerous and various a series of incidents
being to be seen comprised,&mdash;the consequence
is&mdash;that this one topic will unavoidably spread itself
to such an extent, as to cover the whole of the
chronological field of the history of the Church in
those eventful times. A sort of necessity has thus
been found, of taking a view of the principal part
of all those several incidents, in a sort of historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
order, in a succeeding part of this work: hence, of
that which, for the proof of what has just been
advanced, will here be necessary to be brought
to view,&mdash;no inconsiderable portion will be an anticipation,
of that which belongs properly to the historical
sketch, and, but for this necessity, would
have been reserved for it.</p>

<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 4.</h4>

<h5>TOPICS UNDER HIS SEVERAL JERUSALEM-VISITS.</h5>

<p>Thick clouds, and those covering no small portion
of its extent, will, after everything that can be done
to dispel them, be found still hanging over the field
of this inquiry. But, if to the purpose of the present
question, sufficient light be elicited; in whatever
darkness any collateral points may remain still involved,
the conclusion will not be affected by it.</p>

<p>As to the credibility of Paul's story,&mdash;taken in
itself, and viewed from the only position, from which
we, at this time of day, can view it,&mdash;the question has
just been discussed.</p>

<p>That which remains for discussion is&mdash;whether,
from the Church, which Paul found in existence&mdash;the
Church composed of the Apostles of Jesus, and
his and their disciples&mdash;it ever obtained credence.</p>

<p>On this occasion, to the Apostles more particularly
must the attention be directed: and this&mdash;not
only because by their opinion, that of the great body
of those disciples would, of course, on a point of such
vital importance, be governed; but, because, in the
case of these confidential servants and habitual attendants
of Jesus, the individuals, of whom the body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
is composed, and who are designated by one and
the same denomination, are always determinable:
determinable, in such sort, that, at all times, wheresoever
they are represented as being, the eye can
follow them.</p>

<p>To judge with what aspect Paul with his pretensions
was viewed by them, always with a view to the
main question&mdash;whether, in any particular, the alleged
supernatural cause of his outward conversion,
and thence of his presumable inward conversion, ever
obtained credence from them;&mdash;one primary object,
which requires to be attended to, is&mdash;personal intercourse;
viz. the sort of personal intercourse, which
between him on the one part, and them, or some
of them, on the other part, appears to have had
place.</p>

<p>Of this intercourse, the several <i>interviews</i>, which
appear to have had place, will form the links. Correspondent
to those <i>interviews</i> will be found to be so
many <i>visits</i>: all of them, except one, visits made by
him to the great original metropolis of the Christian
world&mdash;Jerusalem:&mdash;the scene of the acts and sufferings
of the departed Jesus:&mdash;the ordinary abode of
these his chosen disciples and successors. If, to
these visits of Paul's is to be added any other interview,&mdash;it
will be in another city, to wit, Antioch:
and, in this instance, between Paul, and not, as in
the case of the other visits might naturally be expected,
the Apostles in a body; but one, or some other
small number of members, by whom a visit to that
place was made, in consequence of their having been
selected for that purpose, and deputed by the rest.</p>

<p>Of the interviews corresponding with these visits,
the real number,&mdash;and not only the real number,
but the number upon record,&mdash;is unhappily, in no
inconsiderable degree, exposed to doubt; for, considering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
the terms they were upon, as we shall see,
at the interviews produced by Paul's first Jerusalem
visit, it does not by any means follow, that, between
the persons in question, because there were two more
such visits, there was, on each occasion, an interview.</p>

<p>Two of them, however, at any rate, if any degree
of credence whatever be given to the documents,
remain altogether clear of doubt: and whatever
uncertainty may be found to attach upon any of the
others, may be regarded as so many fixed points:
fixed points, forming so many standards of reference,
to which the others may in speaking of them
be referred, and by reference to which the reality
and time of those others, will be endeavoured to be
ascertained.</p>

<p>For the designation of the visits which produced
these two unquestionable interviews, the terms <i>Reconciliation
Visit</i>, and <i>Invasion Visit</i>, will here be
employed: the former being that which gave rise to
the first-mentioned of the two interviews, which, after
the conversion, appear for certain to have had place
between the rival and contending powers; the other,
to the last.</p>

<p>1. By the <i>Reconciliation Visit</i> is here meant&mdash;that
visit&mdash;by which was produced the <i>first</i> interview,
which, after the conversion of Paul, had place
between him and any of the Apostles. Its title to
this appellation is altogether unquestionable. After
these proceedings of Paul's, by which the destruction
of so many of the Christians had already been effected,
and that of all the rest was threatened,&mdash;it
was not possible, that, without a reconciliation,&mdash;if
not an inward at any rate an outward one,&mdash;any
interview, on both sides voluntary, should have taken
place. Of the Apostles, Peter was the acknowledged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
chief: that it was for the purpose of seeing Peter,
that a visit of Paul's to Jerusalem&mdash;the first of
those mentioned by him&mdash;was made,&mdash;is acknowledged
by himself: acknowledged, in that Epistle of
his, to his Galatian disciples, of which so much will
have to be said, Gal. i. and ii.<a name="FNanchor_20_22" id="FNanchor_20_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_22" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Without the
assistance of some mediator, scarcely was it in the
nature of the case, that, in any way, any such reconciliation
could have been effected. In the person of
Barnabas,&mdash;a most munificent patron, as will be seen,
of the infant church,&mdash;this indispensable friend was
found.</p>

<p>According to the received chronology, the time of
this visit was A.D. 38. In the account, given in
the Acts, Acts 16:6, of the conjunct missionary excursion
made from Antioch by Paul and Barnabas&mdash;an
excursion, the commencement of which is, by that
same chronology, placed in the year 53,&mdash;<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Galacia'">Galatia</ins>
stands fifth, in the number of the places, which they
are spoken of as visiting. Of any visit, made in
that country, either before this or after it, no mention
is to be found in the Acts, except in Acts 18:23: on
which occasion, he is spoken of as revisiting Galatia,
"strengthening the churches."<a name="FNanchor_21_23" id="FNanchor_21_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_23" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Of what passed on the occasion of this visit, the
account, given as above by Paul, will be seen receiving
explanation, from what is said of this same visit
in the Acts.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<h5>ACTS ix. 26 to 30.</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>26. And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join
himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed
not that he was a disciple.&mdash;But Barnabas took him, and brought
<i>him</i> to the Apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the
Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had
preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.&mdash;And he was with
them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.&mdash;And he spake boldly in
the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but
they went about to slay him.&mdash;Which when the brethren knew, they
brought him down to Csarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.</p></div>

<p>2. By the <i>Invasion Visit</i> is here meant&mdash;that visit
of Paul to Jerusalem, by which his arrestation, and
consequent visit to Rome in a state of confinement,
were produced. <i>Invasion</i> it may well be termed: the
object of it having manifestly been&mdash;the making, in
that original metropolis of the Christian world,
spiritual conquests, at the expense of the gentle sway
of the Apostles: spiritual acquisitions&mdash;not to speak
of their natural consequences, temporal ones. It
was undertaken, as will be seen, in spite of the most
strenuous exertions, made for the prevention of it:
made, not only by those, whose dominions he was so
needlessly invading, but by the unanimous remonstrances
and entreaties of his own adherents.</p>

<p>The date&mdash;assigned to the commencement of this
visit, is A.D. 60. Interval, between this his last
recorded visit and his first, according to the received
chronology, 22 years.</p>

<p>Neither of the occasion of it, nor of any individual
occurrence which took place in the course of it, have
we any account&mdash;from any other source than the
history of the Acts. Paul's account is all in generals.</p>

<p>3. Paul's Jerusalem Visit the Second.&mdash;According
to the Acts, Acts 11:30, "which also they did, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
sent it to the Elders by the hands of Barnabas and
Saul," between these two indisputable interviews
of Paul's with the Apostles occurs another visit,
herein designated by the name of the <i>Money-bringing
Visit</i>. Under the apprehension of a predicted dearth,
money is sent from the Antioch to the Jerusalem
saints. Barnabas, and with him Paul, are employed
in the conveyance of it. Time, assigned to this Visit,
A.D. 43. Of this visit, not any the least trace is to
be found in any Epistle of Paul's. Yet, in this
Epistle of his to his Galatians, he will be seen undertaking
in a manner, to give an account, of every
visit of his to Jerusalem, in which, with reference
to spiritual dominion, between himself and the
Apostles, anything material had ever passed.</p>

<p>By this silence of Paul's, no counter-evidence is
opposed, to the account given of this visit in the
Acts. What may very well be is,&mdash;that he went
along with the money, and departed, without having
had any personal communication with any Apostle,
or even with any one of their disciples.</p>

<p>4. <i>Deputation Visit.</i> Paul's Jerusalem Visit the
Third&mdash;say his Deputation Visit. According to the
Acts,<a name="FNanchor_22_24" id="FNanchor_22_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_24" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Paul being at the Syrian Antioch, certain
men came thither from Judea, teaching, that Mosaic
circumcision is necessary to Christian salvation.
Dissension being thus produced, Paul, and Barnabas
as usual with him, are dispatched to confer on this
subject with the Apostles and the Elders&mdash;Time,
assigned to this visit, A.D. 52. Interval between the
first and this third visit&mdash;years 15.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>
<p>In addition to the first Jerusalem Visit, mentioned
as above by Paul, to wit, in the first chapter of his
Epistle to his Galatians,&mdash;in the second, mention is
made of another.</p>

<p>Of the incidents mentioned by Paul, as belonging
to this other visit, scarcely can any one, unless it be
that of his having Barnabas for a companion, be
found, that presents itself as being the same with
any incident mentioned in the Acts, in the account
given of the above named Deputation Visit. But,
between the two accounts, neither does any repugnance
manifest itself: and, forasmuch as, in a statement,
the purpose of which required that no interview,
in which anything material passed between him
and the Apostles, should pass unnoticed,&mdash;he mentions
no more than one visit besides the first,&mdash;it
seems reasonable to conclude, that it was but one and
the same visit, that, in the penning of both these
accounts, was in view.</p>

<p>As far as appears, it is from the account thus
given by Paul of the second, of the two visits mentioned
by him as made to Jerusalem, that the received
chronology has deduced the year, which it
assigns to the Deputation Visit, as recorded in the
Acts.</p>

<p>In Paul's account alone&mdash;in Paul's, and not in that
in the Acts&mdash;is the distance given in a determinate
number of years. According to one of two interpretations,
17&mdash;the number above mentioned as
adopted in the current chronology&mdash;is the number of
years mentioned by Paul as intervening between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
those two visits. But even in this place, a circumstance
that must not pass altogether unnoticed is,&mdash;that,
according to another interpretation, to which
the text presents itself as almost equally open, the
length of the interval would be considerably greater.
Galatians i. 17: "Neither went I up to Jerusalem
to them which were Apostles before me: but I
went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.
Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem
to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days."
After what period?&mdash;after that of his conversion?
or after the expiration of this his second visit to
Damascus? Reckoning from this latter period, the
interval may be ever so much greater than that of
the three years: for, to the three years may be
added an indefinite length of time for the second,
and even for the first, of his abodes at Damascus.
But, as we advance, reason will appear for concluding,
that, being in the eyes of the Damascus rulers,
as well as the Jerusalem rulers, a traitor&mdash;in the
highest degree a traitor&mdash;his abode at Damascus
could not, at either of these times, have been other
than short as well as secret.</p>

<p>Gal. ii. 1: "Then, fourteen years after, I went up
again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus
also." This being supposed to be the Deputation
Visit, these fourteen added to the former three, make
the seventeen.</p>

<p>5. <i>Peter's Antioch Visit.</i>&mdash;In Paul's Epistle, addressed
to his Galatians, as above,&mdash;immediately
after the mention of his own second Jerusalem Visit
as above, comes the mention of an interview, which
he says he has at Antioch with Peter: "Peter being
come," he says, "to that place." Gal. ii. 11. In
the Acts, 15:22, immediately upon the back of the
accounts of the Deputation Visit, as above,&mdash;comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
an account of what may be called a <i>counter Deputation
Visit</i>. Of the former Deputation Visit, according
to the Acts, the result is&mdash;from the Apostles,
the Elders, and the whole Church, a <i>letter</i>, concluding
with a <i>decree</i>: and "by men chosen of their own company,"
this letter is stated as having been carried to
Antioch: and, with these men, so chosen, Paul and
Barnabas are stated as returning to Antioch, from
which city, as above, they had been deputed. As and
for the names of "chosen men," those of Judas,
surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, are mentioned:
"chief men among the brethren" is another title
by which they are, both of them, distinguished. To
these, no other names are added: in particular, not
that of Peter. Thus far the Acts.</p>

<p>As to Paul, in the account <i>he</i> gives, of the discussion,
to which, after&mdash;and apparently, as above, in
consequence of&mdash;his <i>secondly mentioned</i> interview
with Peter at Jerusalem,&mdash;no mention is made either
of Judas Barsabas, or of Silas: of Peter&mdash;and him
alone&mdash;it is, that, on this occasion, any mention is
made. Peter comes, as it should seem, to Antioch
from Jerusalem; which last city seems to have been
his ordinary abode. But, on this occasion likewise,
in addition to this visitor, mention is again made of
Barnabas, of whom, as far as appears, from the
time of the Reconciliation Visit down to this time,
Antioch was the ordinary abode. In relation to each
of these several Visits, a brief preparatory indication
of the topic or topics, which will be brought to
view, when an account comes to be given of it, may
in this place have its use.</p>

<p>I. <i>Reconciliation Visit.</i>&mdash;On this occasion, a difficulty
that naturally presents itself&mdash;is&mdash;if the relation
is in substance true, and the occasion is the
same&mdash;how it can have happened, that if Peter was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
at Antioch&mdash;Peter, the universally acknowledged
chief of the Apostles&mdash;no mention should be to be
found of him in the Acts: instead of him, two men
as yet unknown&mdash;this <i>Judas Barsabas</i>, and this <i>Silas</i>&mdash;neither
of them of the number belonging to the
goodly fellowship of the Apostles,&mdash;being the only
persons mentioned.</p>

<p>But, for this difficulty, conjecture presents a solution,
in which there is nothing either in itself improbable,
or inconsistent with either of the two accounts&mdash;that
of Paul as above, and that in the Acts. This
is&mdash;that those two were the men, and the only men,
deputed in the first instance: but, that after them,
at no long interval, came thither to their assistance
that chief of the Apostles. Whether the importance
of the question be considered&mdash;to wit, whether, upon
being received as Christians, Gentiles should be
obliged to submit to Mosaic circumcision&mdash;whether
the importance of the question, or the strenuousness
of the debates to which it is spoken of as having
given rise, Acts 15:2, be considered&mdash;the visit of
the chief of the Apostles at Jerusalem, to the scene
of controversy at Antioch, presents not any supposition,
to which any imputation of improbability seems
to attach.</p>

<h5>ACTS xv. 1 to 34.</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. And certain men which came down from Judea taught the
brethren and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of
Moses, ye cannot be saved.&mdash;When therefore Paul and Barnabas
had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined
that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to
Jerusalem unto the Apostles and Elders about this question.&mdash;And
being brought on their way by the Church, they passed through
Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles, and
they caused great joy unto all the brethren.&mdash;And when they were
come to Jerusalem, they were received of the Church, and of the
Apostles and Elders, and they declared all things that God had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
done with them.&mdash;But there rose up certain of the sect of the
Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise
them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.&mdash;And the
Apostles and Elders came together for to consider of this matter.&mdash;And
when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said
unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago
God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should
hear the word of the Gospel, and believe.&mdash;And God which knoweth
the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as
he did unto us:&mdash;And put no difference between us and them, purifying
their hearts by faith.&mdash;Now therefore why tempt ye God to put a
yoke upon the necks of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor
we were able to bear?&mdash;But we believe that through the grace of the
Lord Jesus Christ, we shall be saved even as they.&mdash;Then all the
multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul,
declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the
Gentiles by them.&mdash;And after they had held their peace, James answered,
saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me.&mdash;Simeon hath
declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of
them a people for his name.&mdash;And to this agree the words of the
Prophets; as it is written,&mdash;After this I will return, and will build
again the tabernacle of David which is fallen down; and I will build
again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:&mdash;That the residue of
men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my
name is called, saith the Lord who doeth all these things.&mdash;Known
unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.&mdash;Wherefore
my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from
among the Gentiles are turned to God:&mdash;But that we write unto
them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication,
and from things strangled, and from blood.&mdash;For Moses of old time
hath in every city, them that preach him, being read in the synagogues
every sabbath-day.&mdash;Then pleased it the Apostles and Elders, with
the whole Church, to send chosen men of their own company to
Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; <i>namely</i>, Judas surnamed Barsabas,
and Silas, chief men among the brethren.&mdash;And they wrote letters by
them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send
greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch
and Syria and Cilicia.&mdash;Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain
which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting
your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised; and keep the law; to
whom we gave no such commandment:&mdash;It seemed good unto us,
being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you, with
our beloved Barnabas and Paul;&mdash;Men that have hazarded their lives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.&mdash;We have therefore sent
Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth.&mdash;For
it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you
no greater burden than these necessary things;&mdash;That ye abstain
from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things
strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves,
ye shall do well. Fare ye well.&mdash;So when they were dismissed, they
came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together,
they delivered the Epistle.&mdash;Which when they had read, they rejoiced
for the consolation.&mdash;And Judas and Silas, being prophets also
themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed
them.&mdash;And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in
peace from the brethren unto the Apostles.&mdash;34. Notwithstanding it
pleased Silas to abide there still.</p></div>

<h5>GALATIANS ii. 1 to the end.</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Then fourteen years after, I went up again to Jerusalem with
Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.&mdash;And I went up by revelation,
and communicated unto them that Gospel which I preach
among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation,
lest by any means I should run, or had run in vain.&mdash;But neither
Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.&mdash;And
that because of false brethren unawares brought in,
who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ
Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage.&mdash;To whom we gave
place by subjection, no not for an hour; that the truth of the Gospel
might continue with you.&mdash;But of those, who seemed to be somewhat
(whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me; God accepteth
no man's person) for they who seemed <i>to be somewhat</i>, in conference
added nothing to me.&mdash;But contrariwise, when they saw that the
Gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the Gospel
of the circumcision was unto Peter:&mdash;For he that wrought effectually
in Peter to the Apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty
in me towards the Gentiles.&mdash;And when James, Cephas, and John,
who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto
me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship,
that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.&mdash;Only
<i>they would</i> that we should remember the poor; the same which
I also was forward to do.&mdash;But when Peter was come to Antioch,
I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.&mdash;For
before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles:
but when they were come, he withdrew, and separated himself,
fearing them <i>which were</i> of the circumcision.&mdash;And the other Jews<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
dissembled likewise with him, insomuch that Barnabas also was
carried away by their dissimulation.&mdash;But when I saw that they
walked not uprightly, according to the truth of the Gospel, I said
unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the
manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou
the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?&mdash;We <i>who are</i> Jews by nature, and
not sinners of the Gentiles,&mdash;Knowing that a man is not justified
by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we
have believed in Jesus Christ that we might be justified by the
faith of Christ and not by the works of the law: for by the works
of the law shall no flesh be justified.&mdash;But if while we seek to be
justified by Christ we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore
Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.&mdash;For if I build again the
things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.&mdash;For I
through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.&mdash;I
am crucified with Christ. Nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ
liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by
the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for
me.&mdash;21. I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness
<i>come</i> by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.<br /><br /></p></div>

<p>Of the falsity of his story concerning the manner
of his conversion,&mdash;one proof, that has been given,
has been deduced from the inconsistency, of the
several accounts which we have of it&mdash;all of them
originally from himself&mdash;as compared with one another.</p>

<p>Of the erroneousness of the notion of his having
ever been in the eyes of the Apostles what he professed
himself to be&mdash;of this, and at the same time
of the want of correctness, and trustworthiness, in
every account, which, by him, or from him, is to be
seen rendered, of his proceedings, adventures, and
dangers&mdash;proof will, on the ensuing occasions, be
afforded, by evidence of this same kind: by similar
instances of inconsistency, which will be all along
brought to view.</p>

<p>On the occasion of his <i>first</i> visit to Jerusalem&mdash;to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
the metropolis of Christendom&mdash;will be to be noted&mdash;1.
The cause and manner of his arrival. 2. The
circumstances of his abode&mdash;its duration, and business.
3. The cause and circumstances of his departure.
4. The general result of this his expedition.</p>

<p>1. Of the cause of his visit, and manner of his
arrival, we shall see two different accounts: namely,
one, given by himself directly, in an epistle of his to
his disciples in Galatia; the other, by a man, who
afterwards became his adherent and travelling companion&mdash;namely
the author of the Acts.</p>

<p>2. Of the duration and business of his abode, we
shall see, in like manner, two different accounts,
delivered respectively by those same pens.</p>

<p>3. So, of the cause of his departure;&mdash;from the
same two sources.</p>

<p>4. So, of the circumstances of it.</p>

<p>5. Of the general result of this same expedition of
his, we have no fewer than three different accounts:
namely, the same two as above; with the addition
of a third, as reported, in the Acts, to have been
given by Paul himself, in the course of the speech
he made, at the time of his fourth visit, to an assembled
multitude, headed by the constituted authorities
among the Jews:&mdash;when, after having been
dragged by force out of the Temple, he would&mdash;had
he not been saved by a commander of the Roman
guard&mdash;have been torn to pieces.</p>

<p>On this occasion, we shall find, that, by his own
confession, made for a particular purpose&mdash;for the
purpose of saving his life&mdash;under an exigency which
allowed no time for the study of consistency, and
recorded by the blindness and inconsiderateness of
his biographer;&mdash;we shall find, that the account,
whatever it was, which, on the occasion of this his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
first visit, he gave of himself to the Apostles, failed
altogether in its endeavours to obtain credence.</p>

<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 5.</h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">Topics under Visit II.</span>&mdash;MONEY-BRINGING VISIT.</h5>

<p>Of the occasion and particulars of the second of these
four visits, we have but one account: viz. that which
is to be seen in the Acts.</p>

<p>Compared with what belongs to the other visits,
that which belongs to this is but of small importance.
The information, to be collected from it, will, however,
be seen to be this: namely, that this was the
second, of the attempts he made to join himself to
the Apostles: and that it succeeded no better than
the first. It did not even succeed so well: for, notwithstanding
the claims which the business of it gave
him to their regard&mdash;it was to bring them a sum of
money, the fruit of the liberality of the Church at
Antioch&mdash;he could not so much as obtain admittance
into the presence of any one of them. Without
much hesitation, this may be affirmed. If he had,
he would have made mention of it: for, it will be
seen, that, whatsoever apparent countenance he ever
succeeded in obtaining from them, it was his care to
make the most of it.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 6.</h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">Remarks on Visit III.</span>&mdash;DEPUTATION VISIT.</h5>

<p>Of the occasion, and particulars, and termination, of
the <i>third</i> of these four visits, we have two, and but
two, accounts: one&mdash;that given in the Acts; the other&mdash;that
given by Paul himself, as above, in his letter
to his Galatians: that in the Acts, the only one
which goes into particulars; and which must accordingly
be taken for the basis of the narrative, and in
that character be brought to view in the first instance:
that given by Paul himself confining itself to
generals; but, as far as it goes, much more to be
depended upon, and affording much more instruction,
than that given in the Acts.</p>

<p>Among its immediate consequences, this third visit
appears to have had some sort of intercourse between
Paul and Saint Peter at Antioch&mdash;the next
most considerable seat of the new religion after
Jerusalem; at Antioch, to which city, Paul,&mdash;who,
with Barnabas, had been settled there,&mdash;was on his
return: Peter being then on a temporary visit, made
to that place, for the final settlement of the business,
by which the last preceding visit of Paul to Jerusalem
had been occasioned.</p>

<p>At the time of this visit, the residence of Paul was
at this same Antioch. The occasion of it was&mdash;the
dissemination there, of a doctrine, which, by certain
persons not named, had been imported thither from
Jerusalem: a doctrine, according to which it was
taught to the brethren&mdash;"Except ye be circumcised
after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved."
For the settlement of this important matter,&mdash;Barnabas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
with Paul for his companion, besides other companions
not named, was, by the brethren at Antioch,
now, for the second time, sent, as a delegate, to the
brethren at Jerusalem.</p>

<p>On every one of these three visits, it was under
the protection of this Barnabas (it will be seen) that
Paul had presented himself:&mdash;on the first of them,
for the purpose of making known his conversion,
and, if possible, forming a connection with the
brethren there;&mdash;the second, for the purpose of
bringing them money, the fruits of the respect and
affection of the brethren at Antioch;&mdash;the third time,
for the settlement of this important point of doctrine.
As for Barnabas, he was a <i>Cypriot</i>, who, as will be
seen, had an establishment at Jerusalem: and who,
by his indefatigable zeal, added to his unrivalled
munificence, appears to have obtained an influence
not exceeded by any but that of the Apostles.</p>

<p>Of this same Deputation Visit, being the third of
the recorded visits of Paul to Jerusalem,&mdash;followed
by, and coupled with, one of Peter to Antioch&mdash;Gal.
ii. 11, the place of Paul's residence,&mdash;two most important
results, or alleged results, are mentioned:
the first, mentioned by the author of the Acts alone,
the decree, of a council, composed of the Apostles
and certain other persons, by the name of Elders, at
Jerusalem;&mdash;which decree, together with a letter,
was from thence sent by the hands of Judas Barsabas
and Silas, to the brethren at Antioch; Paul and
Barnabas being of the party, on their return to that
same place: the other result, mentioned by Paul
alone, a sort of <i>partition treaty</i>, by which the field
of doctrinal labour, and thence of spiritual dominion
was divided between him, (Paul), on the one part,
and the Apostles on the other. The <i>Jewish world</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
for a less ambiguous designation would hardly find a
sufficient warrant, to remain with the Apostles; the
<i>Gentile world</i>, to be left free to the exertions of the
declared convert and self-constituted Apostle. As
to the <i>decree and letter</i>, reasons for questioning the
authenticity of these documents will be hereinafter
brought to view, Ch. 6. Of the <i>partition treaty</i>, the
reality presents itself as altogether natural and
probable&mdash;and, by circumstantial as well as direct
evidence, sufficiently established: by direct evidence
supported, by circumstantial evidence confirmed.</p>

<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 7.</h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">Topics under Visit IV.</span>&mdash;INVASION VISIT.</h5>

<p>Of the occasion of the fourth and last of these four
visits&mdash;call it <i>Paul's Invasion Visit</i>&mdash;we have, though
but from one immediate source, what may, to some
purposes, be called two distinct and different accounts,
included one within another: to wit, that
which the historian gives as from himself, and that
which he puts into the mouth of his hero, whose adventures
he is relating. On this subject, from the
mouth of the hero, the historian has not given us,
and probably could not give us, anything but mystery.
From the circumstances, it will be seen,
whether the appellation <i>Invasion Visit</i>, by which
this last of his recorded visits to Jerusalem is here
distinguished, is not fully justified.</p>

<p>Neither, of the occurrences which took place during
the course of it, nor of the mode in which it
terminated, have we any more than one account; viz.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
the account which, speaking in his own person, is
given of it by the author of the Acts.<a name="FNanchor_23_25" id="FNanchor_23_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_25" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>But, upon one part of this account&mdash;and that a
part in itself in no small degree obscure&mdash;light, and
that such as, it is believed, will be found to dispel
the darkness, will be seen thrown, by an article of the
Mosaic law: upon which article, light will be seen
reciprocally reflected, by the application here recorded
as having been made of it. This regards the
<i>Temple scene</i>:&mdash;an expensive ceremony spun out for
days together only to produce the effect of an <i>Oath</i>.</p>

<p>On the occasion of this visit, in spite of a universal
opposition on the part of all concerned&mdash;his own
adherents and dependents, as well as his adversaries
of all classes included,&mdash;Paul, for reasons by himself
studiously concealed,&mdash;and, if brought to light at all,
brought to light no otherways than by inference,&mdash;will
be seen making his entry into Jerusalem, as it
were by force. In the hope of freeing themselves,
as it should seem, of this annoyance, it is,&mdash;that the
rulers of the Christian church, insist upon his clearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
himself from certain suspicions, in the harbouring
of which the whole church had concurred.<a name="FNanchor_24_26" id="FNanchor_24_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_26" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<h4>SECTION 8.</h4>

<h5>SELF-WRITTEN BIOGRAPHY&mdash;ITS SUPERIOR VALUE AND
CLAIM TO CREDENCE.</h5>

<p>On the occasion of this portion of history, it seems
particularly material, to bring to view an observation,
which, on the occasion of every portion of
history, it will, it is believed, be of no small use to
have in remembrance.</p>

<p>In comparison of self-written biography, scarcely
does any other biography deserve the name.</p>

<p>Faint, indeterminate, uninstructive, deceptive, is
the information furnished by any other hand, of
whatsoever concerns the state of the mental frame,
in comparison of what is furnished by a man's own.
Even of those particulars which make against himself,&mdash;even
of those motives and intentions which he
would most anxiously conceal,&mdash;more clear and correct,
as far as it goes, if not more complete&mdash;is the
information given by him, than any which is commonly
afforded, even by an impartial hand. By a
man's own hand, not unfrequently is information
afforded, of a sort which makes against himself, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
which would not, because it could not, have been
afforded by any other hand, though ever so hostile.
He states the self-condemnatory mental facts, the
blindness of self-partiality concealing from his eyes
the condemnatory inference: or, even with his
eyes open, he lays himself under the imputation:
bartering merit in this or that inferior shape, for
the merit of candour, or for the hope of augmenting
the probative force of his own self-serving evidence,
in favour of every other merit for which it is his
ambition to gain credence.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_23_25" id="Footnote_23_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_25"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> Be this as it may, that he must have been in the way to hear,
from various persons present, accounts, such as they were, of what
was said by Paul,&mdash;seems to follow almost of course. This seems
applicable even to the <i>latest</i> of the two occasions; for, though the
place, Csarea, was some distance from Jerusalem, 56 miles,&mdash;yet
the distance was not so great, but that the persons, who were attached
to him, might, for the most part, be naturally supposed to have
followed him: and in particular the historian, who, according to
his history, continued in Paul's suite till, at the conclusion of this
his forced excursion, he arrived at Rome.
</p>
<p>
But, on the subject of <i>possible materials</i>, one concluding query
here presents itself. On a <i>subject</i> such as that in question, on an
<i>occasion</i>, such as that in question, for a <i>purpose</i> such as that in
question, a <i>speech</i> such as either of those in question, might it not,
by a person in the historian's situation&mdash;not to speak of other situations&mdash;be
just as easily made without any special materials, as with
any the most correct and complete stock of materials?</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_24_26" id="Footnote_24_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_26"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> Between Paul's third visit, and that which is here reckoned
as his fourth, another is, by some, supposed<a name="FNanchor_I._27" id="FNanchor_I._27"></a><a href="#Footnote_I._27" class="fnanchor">[I.]</a> to, have been taken place;
on which supposition, this concluding one, which is here styled the
fourth, ought to be reckoned the fifth.
</p>
<p>
But, for the support of this supposition, the grounds referred to
for this purpose do not seem sufficient:&mdash;not that, if the supposition
were true, any consequence material to the present purpose would
follow.
</p>
<p>
For this supposition, what ground there is, consists in a passage
in the Acts:&mdash;Acts 18:20, 21, 22.
</p>
<p>
20. When they, the Jews at Ephesus, desired [him] to tarry longer
time with them, he consented not;
</p>
<p>
But bade them farewell, saying, I <i>must</i> by all means <i>keep this feast
that cometh in Jerusalem</i>; but I will return again unto you, if God
will. And he sailed from Ephesus.
</p>
<p>
And when he had <i>landed</i> at Csarea, and <i>gone up</i>, and saluted
the <i>church</i>, he <i>went down</i> to Antioch.
</p>
<p>
There we have the grounds of the supposition. But, what is the
support they give to it?&mdash;declaration, affirming the existence of an
intention, is one thing; actually existing intention is another. Even
supposing the existence of the intention in question,&mdash;intention is
one thing; corresponding action, another. Jerusalem is not mentioned.
Csarea being on the sea-coast, Jerusalem is indeed in the
interior: and therefore, it may be said, is a place, to which, if a
man went from Csarea, he would "<i>go up</i>:" but, from Csarea,
it being on the coast, a man could not go to any place in Judaea
not on the coast, without <i>going up</i>.
</p>
<p>
So much for <i>place</i>:&mdash;and now as to <i>time</i>. The time mentioned as
the object of the <i>intention</i>, is the <i>passover</i>; but, that the time, at
which, being <i>gone up</i>, Paul "<i>saluted the church</i>"&mdash;this being all
which, upon this <i>going up</i>, he is here stated as doing&mdash;that this time
was the passover, is not stated.
</p>
<p>
As to the <i>salute</i> here stated as given to the <i>church</i>,&mdash;at the conclusion,
and as a material part of the result, of this inquiry, it will
appear plain beyond all doubt, that, if by "<i>the church</i>" be understood
any member of it at Jerusalem, besides two, or at most three,
of the Apostles,&mdash;according to this interpretation, from the time
of his Conversion Visit to Damascus antecedently to his first visit
to Jerusalem, down to the last visit here reckoned as his fourth&mdash;there never
was a day on which the <i>church</i> would have received
his salute.
</p>
<p>
What will also be rendered manifest is&mdash;that it was an object
with the author of the Acts, to induce a belief, that Paul, before the
conclusion of his first visit, was upon good terms with the church,
and so continued to the last: and that, to this end, a purposed misrepresentation
was employed by the historian.
</p>
<p>
Not that, in regard to the visit here in question, to the purpose
of the argument&mdash;it makes any sort of difference, whether it had
place or had not. If it had place, neither the conclusion, nor any
part of the argument, will be seen to require any variation in
consequence.</p></div>

<h3>Paul disbelieved <i>continued</i>.&mdash;<i>First of his four Visits

Visit I. <i>or</i> Reconciliation Visit.&mdash;<i>Barnabas
introducing him from Antioch to the Apostles.</i></h3>

<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 1.</h4>

<h5>PAUL'S PROCEEDINGS BETWEEN HIS CONVERSION AND THIS
VISIT.&mdash;CONTRADICTION. PER PAUL, IT WAS NOT TILL<br />
AFTER THREE YEARS SPENT IN ARABIA; PER ACTS,
IMMEDIATELY.</h5>

<p>Already on another occasion, and for a different
purpose, have the two accounts, between which this
self-contradiction manifests itself, been brought to
view: viz. on the occasion of the accounts, given or
supposed to be given, by Paul, of the cause and
manner of his conversion:&mdash;accounts given in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
first place, in writing, and consequently, with all
requisite time for deliberation, in his Epistle to the
Galatians:&mdash;given, or supposed to be given, in the
next place, by a speech spoken, namely, that which,
in the Acts is reported as spoken by him, on the
occasion of his trial, to Festus and Agrippa:&mdash;Festus,
the Roman Proconsul, Agrippa, the Jewish King.</p>

<p>In the whole account of this matter, as given by
Paul in his Epistle to the Galatians, how much of
truth there probably was, and how much of falsehood
or misrepresentation,&mdash;has been seen already in some
measure, ch. II. i. 5, and will be seen more fully as
we advance.</p>

<p>As to his motive for this visit, he has endeavoured
to keep it to himself: but, by the result, according to
the account he himself gives of it, it is betrayed. It
was&mdash;to effect the so much needed <i>reconciliation</i>:&mdash;his
reconciliation with the Apostles:&mdash;the Apostles,
in relation to whom his disregard is professed, the
need he had of them, no otherwise than virtually,
nor yet the less effectually confessed. Without an
interval of considerable length between his conversion
and this visit, all such reconciliation would have
been plainly hopeless. From this circumstance, the
length, as alleged by him, of his abode in Arabia,
receives obvious and highly probative confirmation.
The confirmation is, indeed, reciprocal. The nature
of his situation, proves the need he had, of an interval
of considerable length, before any hope of reconciliation
could be fulfilled, or, naturally speaking, so much
as conceived: by this circumstance, his abode in some
other country is rendered probable to us: and this
other country may, for aught we know, as well have
been the country mentioned by him&mdash;to wit, <i>Arabia</i>,
as any other: and, thus it is, that this assertion, of
his having been three years in Arabia, between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
time of his departure from Jerusalem to Damascus,
and his return to Jerusalem to see Peter, is confirmed:&mdash;confirmed,
by the natural length, of the
interval, requisite to the affording any, the least
chance, that Peter could be induced to meet upon
terms of amity and intercourse a man, in whom he
beheld the murderer of a countless multitude of
human beings, linked to him by the closest bonds
of self-regarding interest, as well as sympathy and
brotherly love.</p>

<p>As to contradiction, contradiction cannot easily be
much more pointed, than it will be seen to be, between
the account in respect of time, as given in this instance
by Paul, and the account given of it by his
historiographer in the Acts. On a double ground,
it is Paul's account that claims the precedence. Of
<i>his</i> account, such as it is, the rank, in the scale of
trustworthiness, is that of <i>immediate</i> evidence; that
of his historiographer, no higher than that of <i>unimmediate</i>
evidence:&mdash;evidence once removed; having,
for its most probable and least untrustworthy source,
that same <i>immediate</i> evidence. Paul's evidence is,
at the same time, not only more circumstantiated, but
supported by the reasons which he has combined with
it. Not till three years after his alleged miraculous
conversion, did he go near to any of the Apostles.&mdash;Why?&mdash;Because,
though, <i>at</i> that time, for reasons
which he has left us to guess, he had regarded himself
as having considerable need of them,&mdash;<i>till</i> that time
he did not regard himself as having any need of
them. And, why was it, that, for so great a length
of time, he did not regard himself as having any
need of them?&mdash;The answer he himself gives us, Gal.
i. 10: ... "do I seek to please men?&mdash;I certify to you,
brethren, that the Gospel which was preached of
me, is not after man.&mdash;For I received it not of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
man, nor was I taught it but by the revelation of
Jesus Christ.&mdash;When it pleased God, who called me
by his grace,&mdash;to reveal his Son in me, that I might
preach him among the heathen, <i>immediately</i> I conferred
not with flesh and blood:&mdash;Neither went I
up to Jerusalem to them which were Apostles before
me; but I went into Arabia, and returned <i>again</i>
unto Damascus.&mdash;Then after three years I went
up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him
fifteen days.&mdash;But other of the Apostles saw I none,
save James, the Lord's brother."</p>

<p>Thus far Paul himself. Let us now see, what is
said in regard to the time, by his subsequent attendant
and historiographer. Acts ix.... "as he
(Saul) journeyed, he came near Damascus, and,
suddenly there shined round him a light," &amp;c.&mdash;ver.
8. "And Saul arose from the earth, and ... they led
him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.&mdash;And
he was three days without sight, and neither
did eat nor drink.&mdash;And there was a certain disciple
at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the
Lord in a vision ...&mdash;... go into the street called
<i>Straight</i>, and inquire in the house of Judas for one
called Saul of Tarsus....&mdash;17. And Ananias ...
entered into the house, and ... said, Brother Saul,
the Lord ... hath sent me, that thou mightest receive
thy sight....&mdash;And ... he received sight
forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.&mdash;And when
he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then
was Saul certain days with the disciples which
were at Damascus.&mdash;And straightway he preached
Christ in the synagogues,....&mdash;22.... and confounded
the Jews which dwelt at Damascus,....&mdash;And
after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews
took counsel to kill him.&mdash;... and they watched
the gates day and night to kill him.&mdash;Then the disciples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
took him by night, and let him down by the
wall in a basket.&mdash;And when Saul was come to
Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples:
but they were <i>all</i> afraid of him, and <i>believed
not that he was a disciple</i>.&mdash;But Barnabas took him,
and brought him to the <i>Apostles</i>, and declared unto
them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and
that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached
boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus."</p>

<p>With what the historiographer says in his own
person, agrees, as to the particular point now in
question, what, in the studied oration, he puts into
Paul's mouth. In that account likewise, immediately
after the mention of what Paul did at Damascus,&mdash;follows,
the mention of what he did at Jerusalem:
and, as to everything done by him among the Gentiles,
not only does the mention of it come after the
mention of what was done by him at Jerusalem, but,
between the two, comes the mention, of whatever was
done by him, in any of the coasts of Judea. Acts
26:19. "Whereupon, O, King Agrippa, I was not
disobedient unto the heavenly vision:&mdash;but showed,
first unto them of Damascus, and of Jerusalem, and
throughout all the coasts of Judea; and then to the
Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God,
and do works meet for repentance."</p>

<p>Here then, according to Paul's own account, after
his visit to Damascus from Jerusalem, he visited
Arabia, and moreover Damascus a second time, before
he made his visit to Jerusalem to see Peter:
before this visit did he make both those other visits;
and, in making them, pass three years, with or without
the addition, of the time, occupied by his first
visit to Damascus,&mdash;and the time, occupied by his
abode in Arabia. According to Paul's own account
then, between his second departure from, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
arrival at, Jerusalem from thence, there was an interval
either of three years, or of so much more than
three years. On the contrary, according to both the
accounts given of the matter by his historiographer
in the Acts, there was not between the two events
in question, any interval other than such as the
journey from the one to the other&mdash;about 130 British
miles as the crow flies, say about 160, allowance made
for turnings and windings,&mdash;would require.</p>

<p>Now, as between Jews and Gentiles, <i>alias</i> heathens:&mdash;to
which of these two descriptions of persons,
were his preachings addressed in the first instance?</p>

<p>According to his Epistle to his Galatians, preaching
to the heathen being his peculiar destination,
this accordingly is the vocation upon which he proceeded
in the first place: and we have seen how probable
it is, not to say certain, that, in this particular,
what he asserted was true. His appointment being
to "the heathen," he conferred not with flesh and
blood: <i>i.e.</i> with the Apostles, their immediate disciples,
or other flesh and blood of the Christian persuasion:
for, of any such conference&mdash;of any assistance
or support from any such quarter, he has, in
this same Epistle, been declaring and protesting&mdash;most
vehemently protesting&mdash;that he had no need.
Neither then for the purpose of conference with
"those who were Apostles," as he says, "before
him," nor for any other purpose, went he up to
Jerusalem: no, not till either three years after his
conversion, or three years, with the addition of another
term of unmeasurable length.</p>

<p>Now then, how stands this matter according to the
Acts&mdash;according to the speech put into Paul's mouth
by the author of the Acts? Instead of the Gentiles
being the description of persons, to whom, in the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
instance, he applies his labours,&mdash;it is the Jews.
What he <i>shows</i> is "<i>shown</i>," in the first place, to
those "of Damascus;" then "at Jerusalem;" then
"throughout all the coasts of Judea;" and, not till
<i>then</i>&mdash;to the Gentiles: of his abode in Arabia&mdash;of
any visit of his to Arabia&mdash;not any of the slightest
mention, or so much as allusion to it. But, all this
while, for anything that appears to the contrary,
Arabia was completely open to him: whereas, after
the offence he had committed against the authority
of the ruling powers at Judea, it was not, morally
speaking, in the nature of things that he could have
continued in any place coming within that description&mdash;have
continued, long enough to make any sensible
impression: and, in Jerusalem in particular, in
this same Epistle to the Galatians, from which the
above particulars are taken,&mdash;it was, as he himself
declares, only in secrecy, that, even fourteen years
after this, he ventured to disseminate those doctrines,
whatever they were, that were peculiar to
himself, 2nd Gal.: 1, 2. "Then, fourteen years after,
I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and
took Titus with me. And I went up by revelation,
and communicated unto them that Gospel which I
preach among the Gentiles, but <i>privately</i> to them
which were of reputation, lest by any means I
should run, or had run, in vain."</p>

<p>Thus stands the contrariety:&mdash;the contrariety, between
Paul's own account of his own proceedings,
and the account, which, by the author of the Acts, he
is represented as giving of them, on another occasion.
Says Paul <i>himself</i>, in his own Epistle to his
Galatians&mdash;After my conversion, it was to the Gentiles
that I applied myself first: to the Jews, not till
afterwards; nor then, to any considerable extent.
Says the author of the <i>Acts</i>, in a speech, which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
puts into the mouth of Paul&mdash;It was to the Jews that
he applied himself first, and <i>that</i> to a great extent:
to the Gentiles, not till afterwards.</p>

<p>Thus stands the contrariety, taken in itself. As to
the <i>cause</i>, it will neither be far to seek, nor dubious.
In the differences of situations, occasions, and purposes
in view&mdash;in the differences, that had place in
respect of all those particulars&mdash;it will be found.</p>

<p>On the occasion, on which Paul himself speaks,
what was the persuasion which it was his endeavour
to produce? It was&mdash;that, for a number of years,
commencing from the moment of his conversion,&mdash;with
no persons, who, to this purpose, could be called
<i>Jews</i>, had he, to any such purpose as this, had any
intercourse: for, this being admitted, it followed, of
course, that, if, on the subject of the religion of
Jesus, he had really received the information he declared
himself to have received, it was <i>not</i> from the
Apostles, that he had had it, or any part of it. "On
them (says he) I am perfectly independent: to
them I am even superior. With Jesus <i>they</i> had no
communication but in a natural way; with the same
Jesus <i>I</i> have had communication in a supernatural
way:&mdash;in the way of '<i>revelation</i>.' My communication
with him is, moreover, of a date posterior to
theirs&mdash;to any that they can pretend to: in so far
as there is any contrariety between that I teach and
what they teach, it is for theirs, on both these
accounts&mdash;it is for theirs, to yield to mine. From God
is my doctrine: in opposition to it, if either they,
or any other men presume to preserve, let the curse
of God be on their heads. ver. 8. Accordingly, at
the time of my first visit to Jerusalem after my conversion,
no communication had I with them, for, no
such communication, teaching as I did from revelation,
could I stand in need of, I had already passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
three years at least in Arabia, teaching to the Gentiles
there my peculiar doctrine. This peculiar doctrine,
as I made no scruple of teaching it to those
Gentiles, as little, on the occasion of that visit of
mine to Jerusalem, did I make any scruple of teaching
it to Jews as well as Gentiles. True it is, I did
not then teach it publicly:&mdash;I did not teach my
peculiar doctrine, so publicly as they did theirs. But,
as to this comparative secrecy, it had for its cause
the advantage of being free from opposition; for,
had the fact of my teaching this doctrine so different
from theirs&mdash;been known to them,&mdash;they might
have opposed it, and thus my labours might have
been lost."</p>

<p>Whether, in the representation here given of what
he says to his Galatians, there be any misrepresentation,
the reader may judge.</p>

<p>On the occasion, on which <i>his historian</i> represents
him as speaking, what now, as to this same matter,
was the persuasion, which the nature of his situation
required him to endeavour to produce? It was, that
Jews were the sort of persons, with whom, during the
period in question, he had, to the purpose in question,
been holding intercourse: Jews, even in preference
to&mdash;not to say to the exclusion of&mdash;Gentiles:
so far is he from being <i>now</i> represented, as stating
himself to have held converse with Gentiles, to the
exclusion of Jews; which is, that of which he <i>himself</i>
has been seen taking so much pains to persuade
his Galatian disciples. Yes: as far as competition
could have place, Jews, on this occasion, in <i>preference</i>,
at least, to Gentiles: for, on this occasion, what
he was labouring at was&mdash;to recommend himself to
the favour of his Jewish Judge, King Agrippa, Acts
26:8-21, by magnifying the services he had been
rendering to the Jews, his very accusers not excepted:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
services, to the rendering of which, close and
continued intercourse, during that same period,
could not but have been necessary.</p>

<p>On this occasion, being accused of&mdash;his historian
does not choose to say what,&mdash;his defence was&mdash;that,
of the persecution he was suffering, his preaching
the <i>resurrection</i> was the only real cause: that,
having been born and bred a Pharisee,&mdash;in preaching
that doctrine, so far from opposing, he had been
supporting, with all his might, the principles maintained
by the constituted authorities: adducing, in
proof of the general proposition, the evidence furnished
by a particular fact, the resurrection, that
had place in the case of Jesus, Acts 25:19: that
when, in his conversion vision, Jesus gave him his
commission, the principal object of that commission
was&mdash;the instruction of the Gentiles: to wit, by informing
them&mdash;that, to such of them as would believe
in the resurrection, and repent of their sins,
and do works accordingly,&mdash;the benefit of it would
be extended: that to this mandate, it was true, he did
not ultimately fail to pay substantial obedience: yet,
such was his affection for his brethren the Jews,&mdash;that
it was not till, for a considerable time, he had
been conferring on <i>them</i> the benefit of his labours,
that he betook himself to the Gentiles. Acts 26:19.
"I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:&mdash;But
showed first unto them of Damascus, and at
Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judea;
and <i>then</i> to the Gentiles, that they should repent,
&amp;c.&mdash;For these causes the Jews caught me in the
Temple, and went about to kill me."</p>

<p>The repugnancy (says somebody), the repugnancy,
is&mdash;not between Paul and Paul&mdash;but between
Paul and the author of the Acts; and, since the facts
in question are occurrences in which Paul himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
was either agent or patient, to the author of the
Acts, and not to Paul, is the incorrectness, wherever
it be, to be imputed. Be it so: for the purpose of the
argument at least, be it so: but, if so it be, what are
we to think of the author of the Acts? Take away
the author of the Acts, what becomes of Paul? Take
away the authority of the Acts in the character of
an inspired writer&mdash;writing from supernatural
inspiration, after an immediate and continued intercourse,
in some unexplained and inexplicable manner,
with the Almighty,&mdash;what remains, then, of the
evidence, on the ground of which the mighty fabric
of Paul and his doctrine has been erected?</p>

<p>A man, who is thus continually in contradiction&mdash;sometimes
with himself, at other times with the most
unimpeachable authorities&mdash;what credence can, with
reason and propriety, be given to his evidence, in
relation to any important matter of fact? at any rate,
when any purpose, which he himself has at heart, is
to be served by it? Of such a man, the testimony&mdash;the
uncross-examined and uncross-examinable testimony&mdash;would
it, of itself, be sufficient to warrant a
verdict, on a question of the most inconsiderable
pecuniary import? how much less then, on questions, in
comparison of which those of the greatest importance
which the affairs of this life admit of, shrink
into insignificance? Even, suppose veracity, and
every other branch of probity, unimpeached and unimpeachable,&mdash;if
such confusion of mind, such want
of memory, such negligence, in relation to incidents
and particulars, of too immensely momentous a nature,
to escape, at any interval of time, from the most
ordinary mind;&mdash;if such want of attention, such deficiency,
in respect of the most ordinary intellectual
faculties and attainments, are discernible in his narrative,&mdash;what
solid, what substantial ground of dependence
can it furnish, or even leave in existence?</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>Of this sort are the questions for which already no
inconsiderable warrant has, it is believed, been
found; nor, if so, throughout the whole remaining
course of this inquiry, should they ever be out of
mind.</p>

<h4>SECTION 2.</h4>

<h5>GROUNDS OF PAUL'S PROSPECT OF RECONCILIATION ON
THIS OCCASION WITH THE APOSTLES AND THEIR
DISCIPLES.</h5>

<p>On this head, in addition to, and in explanation of,
the sort of narrative given in the Acts,&mdash;information,
of the most instructive and impressive stamp, may
be seen furnished by himself: at the head of it, may
be placed that, which may be seen in his Epistle to
his Galatian converts.</p>

<p>At Jerusalem was the board-room in which sat the
Council of the Apostles: of those men, to whom their
bitterest enemies would not, any more than their
disciples and adherents, have refused the appellation
of constant companions and selected disciples of the
departed Jesus. To them was known, everything
that, in relation to Jesus, was known to any one else:
and moreover, in unlimited abundance, particulars
not capable of being known by any one else.</p>

<p>As to Paul, let us suppose him now a believer in
Jesus; and, on this supposition, note what could not
but have been the state of his mind, with relation to
those select servants of Jesus.</p>

<p>In them he beheld the witnesses&mdash;not only of the
most material and characteristic acts and sayings of
their Master, but of his death, and its supernatural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
consequences&mdash;the <i>resurrection</i> and <i>ascension</i>, with
which it had been followed.</p>

<p>In them he beheld&mdash;not only the witnesses of his
<i>miracles</i>, but a set of pupils, to whom such powers of
working the like miracles&mdash;such miraculous powers,
in a word, as it had pleased him to impart,&mdash;had
been imparted.</p>

<p>In their labours, he beheld the causes of whatsoever
prosperity, he found the society, established by
them, in possession of.</p>

<p>In himself, he beheld the man, who, with such distinguished
acrimony and perseverance, had done his
utmost, for the destruction of that society, into
which, for the purposes, indication of which has been
so clearly given by his own pen, he was preparing to
intrude himself.</p>

<p>To form an ostensible cause for his intrusion,&mdash;in
addition to such information, as, by means of his
persecution, it had happened to him to extract from
those whom he had been persecuting, what, on his
part, had he?&mdash;He had his own learning, his own
talents, his own restless and audacious temper, and
the vision he had got up:&mdash;the baseless fabric of that
vision, a view of which has just been given.</p>

<p>Of the representation thus given of the matter,&mdash;whether
we take his own account of it, or that of
the Acts,&mdash;suppose the truth to rest upon no other
ground than this vision, with or without that other
vision, which has been seen so slenderly tacked to it,
and so strangely inserted into it,&mdash;thus slender is
the ground, on which we shall find him embarking
upon his enterprize,&mdash;assuming to himself, without
modification or apology, the name of <i>an Apostle</i>,&mdash;thrusting
himself into the society, and putting himself
altogether upon an equality, not to say more
than an equality, with the whole company of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
men, whose title to that appellation was above dispute:&mdash;those
of them who, among the chosen, had
been the most favoured, not excepted.</p>


<h5>GALATIANS i. 11-23.</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>11. But I certify you, brethren, that the Gospel which was preached
of me is not after man.&mdash;For I neither received it of man, neither
was I taught <i>it</i>, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.&mdash;For ye have
heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how
that beyond measure I persecuted the Church of God, and wasted
it:&mdash;And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in
mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions
of my fathers.&mdash;But when it pleased God, who separated me from
my mother's womb, and called <i>me</i> by his grace,&mdash;To reveal his Son
in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I
conferred not with flesh and blood,&mdash;Neither went I up to Jerusalem
to them which were Apostles before me; but I went into Arabia,
and returned again unto Damascus.&mdash;Then after three years I
went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.&mdash;But
other of the Apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.&mdash;Now
the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I
lie not.&mdash;Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;&mdash;And
was unknown by face unto the Churches of Judea which were
in Christ.&mdash;But they had heard only, that he which persecuted us
in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.<br /><br /></p></div>

<p>Thus, however indistinctly and incoherently stated,
stands the matter, on the surface of both these
accounts. On the surface. But, by a little reflection on
the nature of the case&mdash;the obvious and indisputable
nature of the case&mdash;as collected from all accounts, as
already brought to view in a preceding chapter II,
we shall be led to another conception, and the only
tenable one.</p>

<p>The plan of worldly ambition&mdash;that plan by which
we have already seen his outward conversion
produced&mdash;had been not only formed, but acted upon:&mdash;acted
upon, during a course of at least three years:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
of three years, employed at Damascus in preparation,&mdash;in
Arabia in probation. What remained, and
was now become necessary, was&mdash;some sort of countenance
from the Apostles: from the Apostles, and
thence, if possible, from the rest of the then existing
Church. Necessary altogether was this countenance
for his support: for, to this plan the <i>name</i> of Jesus
was essential. It was in that <i>name</i>, that all his operations
were to be carried on:&mdash;in that name, from
the use of which it was to be universally understood,
that it was according to directions, and with support,
from the departed Jesus, that by this, his newly-enlisted
servant, everything was said and done.</p>

<p>In Damascus&mdash;yes:&mdash;in Damascus, where were the
only persons, with whom, for the purpose of his dominion,
he could with safety communicate: that is
to say, persons, whom his commission from the
Jerusalem authorities had placed under his power. In
Arabia&mdash;yes: where, though he had made no progress
of which he saw any advantage in giving any
account&mdash;he at any rate had not experienced any
opposition, of such a sort as to engage him to drop
his scheme. In those comparatively distant countries&mdash;yes.
But, in Jerusalem&mdash;the birthplace of
Jesus and his religion,&mdash;in that metropolis, within
which, or the near neighbourhood of it, all the witnesses
of its rise and progress&mdash;all the proselytes,
that had been made to it, were collected,&mdash;and from
whence, and to which, the votaries of that religion,
out of which it had sprung, would be continually
flocking from all quarters;&mdash;in this place, for a man,
known so notoriously to them all as a persecutor, in
whose scheme of persecution they had all of them
been involved,&mdash;for such a man to have, all on a
sudden, begun preaching and acting, in the name of
that Jesus, whom, to use his own language, he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
persecuted&mdash;such an enterprise as this, which, even
with the utmost support which it was in their power
to give, would have been audacity, would, without
some sort of countenance from them,&mdash;have been
downright madness.</p>

<p>To perfect success it was necessary, that not only
these shepherds of the Church pasture, but, through
them the whole flock, should thus be brought under
management. So far as regarded those same <i>rulers</i>,
we shall find him, in a certain degree,&mdash;and even,
with reference to his purpose, in a sufficient degree,&mdash;successful.
But, with reference to the Disciples in
general, and to all those rulers but three,&mdash;it will be
seen to have completely failed.</p>

<p>Circumstanced as he was, to those rulers alone,
was it possible for him to have addressed himself,
with any the smallest hope. To any assembly of the
faithful at large, to have repaired with no better
recommendation than his vision story,&mdash;even with Barnabas,
ready, as we shall see, to take him by the
hand,&mdash;would have been plainly hopeless. Not less
so would it have been&mdash;to present himself to the
Apostles,&mdash;if, in support of such proposition as he
had to make,&mdash;nothing more apposite, nothing to
them in their situation more credible, than this same
vision story,&mdash;had been capable of being produced.
On them, therefore, the case seems already pretty
well ripe for the conclusion, that, no such story was
ever attempted to be passed. But, setting aside that
arial argument,&mdash;inducements of a more substantial
nature, such as we shall find brought to view by Paul
himself, were neither on this occasion wanting,&mdash;nor
could, at any time, have been out of the view of
that same Barnabas, whom we shall see appearing
so often, in the character of his generous patron and
steady friend. "On this plan, might Barnabas say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
to them,&mdash;On this plan, which he has chalked out
for himself, he will be acting&mdash;not only not in
opposition to, but even in furtherance of, your
wishes and endeavors. Grecian as he is,&mdash;skilled
in that language, and that learning, which serves
a man as a passport through the whole of the Gentile
world,&mdash;it is to that world that his labours will
confine themselves; a field surely ample enough for
the most comprehensive views. To you he will
leave,&mdash;and leave certainly without privation, and
therefore naturally without regret,&mdash;that field, of
which you are already in possession,&mdash;and, by the
boundaries of which, your means of convenient
culture are circumscribed."</p>

<p>"On this plan,&mdash;not only will your exertions remain
unimpeded, but the influence of the name of
Jesus&mdash;that name, on the influence of which those
same exertions are so materially dependent for
their success,&mdash;will, in proportion to Paul's success,
be extended."</p>

<p>In a discourse, to this effect, from the generous
and enlightened mediator,&mdash;may be seen the natural
origin of that agreement, which, further on in its
place, under the name of the <i>partition treaty</i>, there
will be occasion to bring, in a more particular manner,
under review.</p>

<p>But, what is little less evident, than the propriety
and prudence of this plan, viewed at least in the
point of view in which it might not unnaturally be
viewed by Barnabas, is&mdash;the impossibility, of coming
forward, with any tolerable prospect of success, with
any such plan in hand, in presence of a vast and
promiscuous assemblage. To engage, on the part of
any such assemblage, not to say any steady confidence,
but any the slightest hope,&mdash;that, from an
enemy even to death, the same man would become a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
partner and assistant,&mdash;would require a most particular
and protracted exposition, of all those facts
and arguments, which the requisite confidence would
require for its support:&mdash;a detail, which no such
assembly would so much as find time to listen to, were
it possible for it to find patience.</p>

<p>Even in the case of the Apostles themselves,&mdash;taking
the whole council of them together, the nature
of the plan, it will be seen, admitted not of any successful
negotiation. Accordingly, to the chief of
them alone, to wit, to Peter, was it so much as the
intention of Paul to make any communication of it
in the first instance: and, in the whole length of the
intercourse, such as it was, that he kept up with,
them&mdash;in all the four visits, in the course of which
that intercourse was kept up&mdash;being a period of not
less than twenty-five years, to wit, from the year 35 to
the year 60,&mdash;with no more than three of the eleven,
will he be seen so much as pretending to have had
any personal interview: <i>they</i> not seeing him, except
when they could not avoid it; and <i>the others</i> never
seeing him at all.</p>

<h4>SECTION 3.</h4>

<h5>OCCASION OF THIS VISIT, AS PER PAUL'S OWN ACCOUNT.</h5>

<p>After his conversion&mdash;after the time at which, if
he is to be believed, he saw that first-mentioned of
his visions&mdash;that vision, by which the most strenuous
opponent of the new religion was changed into one
who, in profession, was the most active of its supporters,&mdash;what
was the course he took? Did he repair
immediately to Jerusalem from whence he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
came? Did he present himself to the eleven Apostles&mdash;to
the confidential companions of the departed
Jesus, to lay before them his credentials? to report
to those by whom everything about Jesus that was to
be known to man was known&mdash;what had been experienced
by him?&mdash;by him, Paul, by whom, till the moment
of that experience, nothing of it whatever had
been known? Not he, indeed. Behold what he says
himself.</p>

<p>Instead of so doing, off he goes, in the first
instance to Arabia; from whence, at the end of a length
of time not specified, he returns to Damascus.
At length, however, to Jerusalem he does repair:
at length, into the presence of those against whose
lives he had so long conspired,&mdash;he now uses his
endeavours to intrude himself.</p>

<p>At length? at the end then of what length of time?
At the end of three years? Yes: but from what
point of time computed? From the time of his
conversion on the road,&mdash;or from the last day of his
stay at Damascus, upon his return thither from
Arabia? By that man, let an answer to these
questions be given&mdash;by that man who can find grounds
for it.</p>

<p>Thus much, however, may, at any rate, be said:&mdash;of
the length of this interval three years is the minimum.</p>

<p>In what view did it occur to him to seek this conference?
in what view to make the attempt? and in
what view delay it?</p>

<p>1. As to his view in seeking it,&mdash;it must be left to
inference:&mdash;to conjecture, grounded on circumstances.</p>

<p><ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads '1'">2</ins>. Being engaged, as he was, in the plan of making
converts to a religion, called by him the religion
of Jesus,&mdash;and this among the nations at large&mdash;among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
others besides those in the bosom of whose
religion the founder of the new religion had been
born;&mdash;feeling, as it seemed to him, the need, of
information in various shapes&mdash;concerning the acts
and sayings of Jesus;&mdash;not having, for the purpose,
had, as yet, access, to any of the persons, to whom
the benefit, of an interview with Jesus, upon terms
of peculiar confidence, had been imparted;&mdash;he was
desirous, of taking this&mdash;his only course&mdash;for rectifying
the misconception, under which, to no small
extent, he must probably have been labouring,&mdash;and
filling up the deficiencies, under which he could not
but be labouring.</p>

<p>3. Obvious is the need he had, of countenance from
these universally acknowledged chiefs, of the religion
professed to be taught by him.</p>

<p>Good, says some one: but, having, from the first,
been thus long labouring, under the need of information,&mdash;how
happened it, that he so long delayed, the
exertions he made at length, for the obtaining of it?</p>

<p>The answer is surely not unobvious.</p>

<p>Had the time, of his presenting-himself, been
when the memory of his conversion was fresh,&mdash;when
the memory, of the vision, by which it was to
be stated as having been effected, would, supposing
it really experienced, have been fresh also,&mdash;in such
case, the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'narative'">narrative</ins>, true or untrue, would have found,
opposed to its reception, all imaginable repugnance,
in so many ulcerated minds: and, on the supposition
of its being untrue, he&mdash;the supposed percipient and
actually narrating witness&mdash;he, who knew nothing
about the subject of his testimony, would have had to
submit himself to the severest imaginable cross-examination,
at the hands of those, to whom everything
about Jesus was matter of perfect knowledge.</p>

<p>Thus the matter would have stood, in the first instance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
On the other hand, as time ran on, several
results, favourable to his design, would naturally
have taken place.</p>

<p>1. The exasperation, produced by the experience
of the persecution suffered at his hands, would have
been diminished.</p>

<p>2. His own recollection, of the particulars, might
be supposed less vivid.</p>

<p>3. The curiosity, respecting them, would have
become less eager.</p>

<p>4. Time might have given admission to behaviour
on his part, of a sort, by which distrust might be
lessened, confidence strengthened.</p>

<p>Well; now we have him at Jerusalem,&mdash;and for
the first time after his conversion. When thus, at
Jerusalem,&mdash;of those whom he went to see, whom did
he actually see? Answer, Peter for one; James,
whom he styles the Lord's brother, and who, according
to him, though not literally a brother, was, however,
a kinsman of Jesus:&mdash;these two, according to
his own shewing; these two, and no more. "Then
after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see
Peter, and abode with him fifteen days. But of the
other Apostles saw I none, save James, the Lord's
brother." Gal. 1:18, 19.</p>

<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 4.</h4>

<h5>OCCASION, AS PER ACTS ACCOUNT COMPARED WITH
PAUL'S.</h5>

<p>Such as hath been seen is Paul's account of the
matter:&mdash;Paul's own account, of the interval that
elapsed, between his conversion, and the first of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
subsequent visits to Jerusalem:&mdash;to the residence of
the Christians, whom he had been persecuting, and
of the rulers, under and by the authority of whom,
the persecution had been carried on. Such, loose as
it is, is his account, of the interval between these two
events: and of the place, in which, either almost the
whole, or at any rate the greatest part of it, was
passed.</p>

<p>Such was Paul's own account of his own proceedings,&mdash;at
the distance of twenty-five years and more.
Compare with it, now, the account, given by his
historiographer&mdash;given, of the interval, that, according
to him, had place, between these same two events.
Acts 9:19-29.</p>

<p>Here, no three years' sojournment in Arabia: no
visit to that country: no notice, of any place, other
than Damascus, as being a place, in which the whole,
or any part, of the time in question, was passed. In
a position, with respect to each other, scarcely different
from that of contiguity,&mdash;are the two events
brought together. The blood of their disciples scarce
washed from off his hands, when, with Barnabas for
his introducer, he presents himself to the Apostles!</p>

<p>At the very time, when the Jerusalem rulers, would
have been expecting to receive from him, the proofs
of his punctuality, in the execution of the important
plan, of official oppression, of which, at his own
instance, he had been solemnly constituted and
appointed the instrument; when, after going over to
and forming a league with the criminals, for such
they must have been called, whom he had been
commissioned by these rulers to bring to justice;&mdash;at this
very time it is, that he returns to the seat of their
dominion:&mdash;to the place in which, at that very time,
his return to them, with the intended victims in captivity,
could not but be the subject of universal expectation!</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>Let any one now judge, whether, in any state of
things, natural or supernatural, the sort of conduct
thus supposed is credible.</p>

<p>At Damascus, instead of presenting himself to the
Damascus rulers, to whom the commission of which
he was the bearer was addressed,&mdash;the first persons,
whom, according to this account, Acts 9:19, he sees,
are "the disciples," <i>i.e.</i>, the persons whom, by that
commission, he was to arrest: and, with them, instead
of arresting them, he passes "certain days."</p>

<p>These certain days ended,&mdash;does he thereupon,
with or without an apology, present himself to these
same rulers? Not he, indeed. Not presenting himself
to them, does he, by flight or otherwise, take
any measures, for securing himself, against their
legitimate and necessarily intended vengeance? No
such thing:&mdash;instead of doing so, he runs in the very
face of it. He shows himself in the Jewish synagogues,
in the public places of worship: and there,
instead of preaching Moses and his law, he preaches
Christ,&mdash;that Christ, whose disciples he was commissioned
to extirpate.</p>

<p>This breach of trust&mdash;this transgression, which,
however commendable in itself, could not but,&mdash;in
the eyes of all those by whom, or for whom, he was
in trust,&mdash;be a most flagitious and justly punishable
act of treachery,&mdash;could it even from the first, for
so much as two days, together, remain unknown?
Not it, indeed: if, in this particular, to this same
conversion story, as related by this same author, any
credit is due. For, according to this same account,&mdash;in
this same journey, and at the very time of his
conversion vision, was he alone? No; he had companions:
companions, who, whatsoever became of
him, would, at the very time of his entrance, unless
any cause can be shown to the contrary, have entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
thither in due course. Well, then&mdash;ask the men in
authority,&mdash;"This Paul, in whose train you came,&mdash;where
is he, what has become of him?" Such would
of course have been the questions put to these, his
companions, even on the supposition, that by these
same companions, no visit had, of their own accord,
been paid to these same rulers, under whose authority
they went to place themselves.</p>

<p>At length,&mdash;and the days which by this time had
elapsed were "<i>many</i>,"&mdash;he finds it expedient to quit
Damascus. He is driven from thence: but by what
force? By the exercise of the legal authority of the
offended rulers? in a word, by public vengeance? No:
but by a private conspiracy&mdash;nothing more: for, to
these rulers,&mdash;so different are they from all other
rulers,&mdash;whether their authority is obeyed or contemned,
has, all the while, been matter of indifference.</p>


<h5>ACTS ix. 19-30.</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>19. And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then
was Saul <i>certain days</i> with the <i>disciples</i> which were at Damascus.&mdash;And
straightway he preached <i>Christ</i> in the synagogues, that he is
the Son of God.&mdash;But all that heard him were amazed, and said, Is
not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem,
and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them
bound unto the chief priests?&mdash;But Saul increased the more in
strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving
that this is very Christ.&mdash;And after that <i>many days</i> were fulfilled,
the Jews took counsel to kill him:&mdash;But their laying await was
known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to
kill him.&mdash;Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down
by the wall in a <i>basket</i>.&mdash;And when Saul was come to Jerusalem,
he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid
of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.&mdash;But Barnabas took
him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how
he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him,
and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
Jesus.&mdash;And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.&mdash;And
he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed
against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him.&mdash;30. Which,
when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Csarea, and
sent him forth to Tarsus.<br /><br /></p></div>

<p>In the above account&mdash;a remarkable incident is
presented, by the occasion and manner of his escape
from Damascus. In part, it has for its support an
assertion made by Paul himself; but, as usual, as to
part it is scarcely reconcileable with the account he
gives of it. In respect of the adventure of the <i>basket</i>,
the two accounts agree: and thus the occasion is
identified and fixed. It is in respect of the description
of the persons, by whom the attack upon him was
made or meditated, that the accounts differ. According
to the Acts, the hostile hands are those of
the Jews, who are spoken of as so many unauthorized
and criminal conspirators: but, according to Paul,
they are those of the constituted authorities&mdash;a governor
acting under a king.</p>

<p>31. "In Damascus"&mdash;says he, in 2 Cor. 11:32-33&mdash;"In
Damascus, the governor under Aretas the king
kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison,
desirous to apprehend me. And through a window
in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped
his hands."</p>

<p>Now, supposing the adverse force to have been
that of a band of conspirators, it was natural for
them to watch the "city gates": a more promising
resource they could scarcely have had at their command.
But, suppose it to have been that of the governor,&mdash;what
need had he to watch the gates? he
might have searched houses. By the reference made,
to a matter of fact, which, supposing it real, must
in its nature have been notorious&mdash;to wit, the existence
of a king, of the name in question, in the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
in question, at the time in question&mdash;a comparative
degree of probability seems to be given to Paul's
account. A curious circumstance is&mdash;that, in this
Epistle of Paul's, this anecdote of the Basket stands
completely insulated; it has not any the slightest
connection with anything that precedes or follows
it.</p>

<p>In the Acts' account, as already observed, Chap. 4,
it looks as if it was immediately after the adventure
of the basket, that he went on this his first visit to
the Apostles at Jerusalem: for, as we see, it is immediately
thereupon that his arrival at that city is
mentioned. If so, the abode he had <i>then</i> been making
at Damascus, was probably <i>after</i> his return from
Arabia: that return from Arabia, which we have
seen him speaking of in his Epistle to the Galatians,
Gal. i. 15. "When it pleased God ... to reveal his
son to me, that I might preach him to the heathen;
immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood;
Neither went I up to Jerusalem, to them which
were Apostles before me; but I went into Arabia,
and returned again unto Damascus. <i>Then after</i>
three years, I went up to Jerusalem, to see Peter."
&amp;c.</p>

<p>"After three years?"&mdash;three years, reckoning
from what <i>time</i>? Here we see the ambiguity, and
along with it the difficulty. If reckoning from his
conversion,&mdash;then we have the three years, to be
spent&mdash;partly in Damascus, partly in Arabia: in
Damascus, in obtaining, perhaps, from the Christianized
Jews&mdash;in return for the impunity given to
them by the breach of the trust committed to him
by the Jerusalem rulers&mdash;money, for defraying his
expenses while in Arabia. If, reckoning from his
escape from Damascus in a basket, then we have
three years, during which not so much as any the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
faintest trace of him is perceptible. All, therefore,
that is clear is&mdash;that according to his account of the
matter, there was an interval of at least three years
between his conversion, and this first of his subsequent
Jerusalem visits&mdash;this visit of his to Jerusalem,
to see the Apostles.</p>

<p>Between the two interpretations,&mdash;in respect of
length of time, observe here the difference. According
to one of them, between the conversion and the
first Jerusalem visit, we have an interval of three
years, and no more: and, in this interval, three
lengths of time&mdash;one passed in Damascus, another
in Arabia, a third, terminated by the basket adventure,
passed also in Damascus, are all included: the
entire interval determinate: but its parts, all of them,
indeterminate. According to the other interpretation,
we have also three lengths of time: the first,
indeterminate, passed in Damascus; the second, as
indeterminate, passed in Arabia; the third, passed
in Damascus, and this a determinate one&mdash;namely,
the three years. Thus, upon the first supposition, the
interval consists of three years, and no more: upon
the second supposition, it consists of three years,
preceded by two lengths of time, which are both
indeterminate, but one of which&mdash;that passed in
Arabia&mdash;may have been to any amount protracted.</p>

<p>Upon either supposition,&mdash;it seems not unlikely,
that it was immediately after his escape from Damascus,
that this first visit of his to Jerusalem took
place. And, the greater the preceding interval of
time, whether passed in Arabia or Damascus, the
less unpromising his prospect, that the resentments,
produced by the provocations given by him to the
Christians, by his persecution of them,&mdash;and to the
Jewish rulers, by his treachery towards them,&mdash;should,
both, have to such a degree subsided, as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
render even so short a stay, as that of fifteen days
which he mentions, consistent with personal safety.
Yet, as we see in the Acts, are these two events
spoken of as if they had been contiguous: at any
rate, it is in contiguity that they are spoken of.</p>

<p>Uncertainties crowd upon uncertainties. At the
time of Paul's conversion,&mdash;had Damascus already
this same king, named Aretas, with a governor under
him? If so, how happens it, that, of this state of
the government, no intimation is perceptible, in the
account given of that conversion in the Acts? Was
it&mdash;that, at that time, there existed not any such
monarchical personage? but that, before the adventure
of the basket, some revolution had placed him
there?</p>

<p>According to Paul's account,&mdash;the state of things,
produced in Damascus by his exertions, was somewhat
curious. On the face of this account, in ordinary
there was no <i>garrison</i> in Damascus: it was only
by special order from the monarch, and for no other
purpose than the bringing to justice&mdash;or what was
called justice&mdash;the person of the self-constituted
Apostle,&mdash;that a garrison was put into the town, with
a governor for the command of it.</p>

<p>What a foundation all this for credence! and, with
it, for a system of religious doctrine to build itself
upon!&mdash;religious doctrine&mdash;with the difference between
eternal happiness and eternal misery depending
upon it!</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<h4>SECTION 5.</h4>

<h5>CAUSE OF THE DISCORDANCE BETWEEN THE TWO
ACCOUNTS.</h5>

<p>Between these two accounts, such being the discordance&mdash;where
shall we find the <i>cause</i> of it? Answer:
in the different views, in which, at the time
of writing, the two accounts were penned: in the
different objects, to the accomplishment of which, at
the time of penning their respective accounts, the
endeavours of the two writers were directed.</p>

<p>The author of the Acts&mdash;what, then, was <i>his</i> object?
To obtain for his patron&mdash;his chief hero&mdash;alive or
dead&mdash;a recognition, as universal as possible, in his
assumed character of an Apostle. The more complete
the recognition, bestowed upon him by those
most competent of all judges,&mdash;the more extensive
the recognition he might look for, at the hands of all
other their fellow-believers.</p>

<p>Sufficient was this&mdash;sufficient for the general purposes
of the party&mdash;in the eyes of a person other than
Paul, even though that other person was a proteg, a
retainer, a satellite.</p>

<p>Sufficient this was not, however, to the arrogance
of the head of the party&mdash;Paul himself: at least, at
the time of his writing this his letter to his Galatian
converts.</p>

<p>Think you, says he, that any relation, I have ever
borne to any of those who were Apostles before me,
had, on my part, anything in it of dependence?
Think you, that I ever stood in need of anything at
their hands? Think you, that I had ever any more
need of them, than they of me? Not I, indeed. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
Gospel, which I have always preached&mdash;neither from
them did I receive it, nor from them, in preaching it,
did I ever seek or receive any assistance. Gal. i. 11,
12. Think you, that I stood in any need, or ever
supposed myself to stand in any need, of any acceptance
or acknowledgement at their hands? Not I,
indeed. When my revelation had been received by
me, did I present myself to them, for any such purpose
as that of remuneration and acceptance? Not I,
indeed. I went not to them: I went not so much as to
Jerusalem, where they then were: I conferred not
with flesh and blood:&mdash;off I went to Arabia; and
when my business in Arabia was at an end, even then,
did I repair to Jerusalem? Not I, indeed. I returned
again to Damascus. True it is, to Jerusalem
I did go at last.&mdash;But when?&mdash;Not till three years
afterwards. Well&mdash;and, when I was at Jerusalem,
how many, and which of them, think you that I saw?
Think you, that I put myself to any such trouble, as
that of seeing them all together? the whole herd of
them? No. Peter was naturally a chief among
them: with him I had accordingly some business to
settle:&mdash;him, accordingly, I saw, as also James,
whom, as being a brother, or other near kinsman, of
Jesus, I had a curiosity to see.</p>

<p>Paul himself wrote at one time; this his disciple
at another: each of them pursued the purpose of the
time. Not on this occasion, at any rate,&mdash;perhaps
not on any other, was there anything, that either
wrote, concerted between them.<a name="FNanchor_25_28" id="FNanchor_25_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_28" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Of this want of
concert, what has just been seen is one of the consequences.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>
<p>Reserved as we have seen him, in regard to time
and other circumstances,&mdash;one circumstance more
there is, for which our curiosity is to no small
amount, debtor, to the author of the Acts. This is&mdash;information,
of the means&mdash;of the channel, through
which Paul obtained the introduction, which, without
mention made of the object, we have seen him acknowledging
that, so far as concerned Peter, he was
desirous of: and <i>that</i> to such a degree, as to undertake
a journey from Damascus to Jerusalem, some
120 or 130 miles, for the purpose.</p>

<p>Repugnancy, so natural, and naturally so vehement&mdash;even
at the end of three years, or the still
greater number of years&mdash;by what means could he
remove it, or so much as flatter himself with a prospect
of being able to remove it? To this question,
it is to the author of the Acts that we are indebted
for an answer: and that answer a satisfactory one:&mdash;it
was by the assistance of Barnabas, that the object,
so far as it was accomplished, was accomplished.</p>

<p>To the religion of Jesus, after as well as before
this,&mdash;to the Apostles in particular before this,&mdash;Barnabas
was a supporter of no small importance.</p>

<p>At the time when the financial arrangements were
for the second time settled;<a name="FNanchor_26_29" id="FNanchor_26_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_29" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>&mdash;when, from the substance
of the opulent among the faithful, enough was
collected for the support of all the indigent;&mdash;among
those, by whom, on this second occasion, lands and
houses, were for this purpose sold, particular persons
are, on this second occasion, for the first time
mentioned. The first place is occupied by this Barnabas:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
and not till after him come Ananias and Sapphira&mdash;the
unfortunate pair, of whose fate mention
will have to be made in another place.</p>

<p>Joses was, it seems, the original name&mdash;the proper
name of this beneficent protector: Barnabas, the
<i>Son of consolation</i>, Acts 4:36, was no more than
a title of honour,&mdash;a token of gratitude. A title of
honour? and by whom conferred? Even by the
Apostles. By Barnabas, therefore, whatsoever thereafter
comes to be reported as done,&mdash;it is by <i>the
Son of consolation</i> that we are to understand it to
have been, and to be, done.</p>

<p>As to the arguments, by which this son of consolation
succeeded,&mdash;in prevailing, upon two, and, if
we are to believe Paul, no more than two, of these
so lately persecuted or threatened servants of Jesus,&mdash;to
be, for a few days, upon speaking terms, with
him, who so lately had been their deadly, as well as
open enemy,&mdash;it is from imagination, with judgment
for her guide, that they must, if at all, be deduced
from the surrounding circumstances of the case.</p>

<p>As to these arguments, however,&mdash;whatever were
the rest of them, of two of them a hint is given by
the author of the Acts: these are,&mdash;the story of the
conversion,&mdash;and the boldness of the preaching,
which at Damascus was among the first-fruits of it.
Those which, under the guidance of judgment, imagination
would not find much difficulty in adding,
are,&mdash;the evil&mdash;that might result from his enmity, in
case the advances then made by him were rejected,&mdash;and
the useful service, which, by the blessing of God,
might be hoped for at his hands, if admitted in the
character of an ally and cooperator: at any rate,
so long as the whole field of his exertions, and in
particular the geographical part of it, continued
different from theirs.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>With Peter, on whatever account, it was Paul's
own desire to hold a conference:&mdash;so we have seen
him declaring to the Galatians. To this Peter, whom
he was desirous of seeing, and whom at length he
succeeded in seeing,&mdash;to this Peter did he then himself
tell the story of his vision, of his conversion, and
the mode of it? If at any time he did,&mdash;at any rate,
if the author of the Acts is to be believed,&mdash;it was
not till Barnabas, the son of consolation, had told
it for him. Had it been by himself that his story
had been to be told in the first instance,&mdash;he would
thereby have stood exposed to cross-examination:
and, among those things, which Barnabas might in
his situation say for him,&mdash;were many things, which,
if at all, he could not, with anything like an equal
prospect of good effect, have said for himself. To
any asseveration of his own,&mdash;in any promises of
future amity, it was not in the nature of the case,
that from his own mouth they should give credence.
But, when by Barnabas, of whose zeal in their cause
they had received such substantial proofs&mdash;when
from this son of consolation they received assurance,
that Paul had actually engaged himself in that line
of service, which he professed himself desirous to
embrace;&mdash;that he had engaged so far, that no prospect
of safe retreat could reasonably be in his view;&mdash;then
it was, that, without imprudence, they might,
venture to hold at least a conference with him, and
hear and see what he had to say for himself.</p>

<p>As to the account, given on this occasion by Barnabas,
of the famous vision,&mdash;had it been but preserved,
it would probably have been no less curious than
those which we have been already seeing. Though
we cannot be precisely assured in what way,&mdash;we
may be pretty well assured, that, in some way or
other, additions would have been to be seen made in
it, to the list of <i>variations</i>.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>But, the great advantage,&mdash;producible, and probably
produced, by the opening of the matter, as performed
by Barnabas,&mdash;was this: in company with
those arguments, by which the sincerity of Paul was
to be demonstrated,&mdash;would naturally come those,
by which intimation would be given, of the advantage
there might be, in forbearing to apply too strict a
scrutiny, to this important statement. The interests,
which, in the character of motives, pleaded for the
acceptance, of the advance made towards reconciliation
and mutually advantageous cooperation,&mdash;would,
in this manner, prepare the way, for receiving,
without any troublesome counter-interrogation,
the important narrative: or, perhaps, for considering
the matter, as already sufficiently explained, by
the son of consolation,&mdash;in such sort that, to the new
Apostle, the trouble of repeating a narrative, which
he must already have so frequently found himself
under the necessity of repeating, might be spared.</p>

<p>The greater was the importance, of the service
thus rendered to Paul by the son of consolation,&mdash;the
more studiously, in giving the account, as above,
of the intercourse with the Apostles at Jerusalem,&mdash;the
more studiously, would he avoid all mention of
it.<a name="FNanchor_27_30" id="FNanchor_27_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_30" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 6.</h4>

<h5>LENGTH OF THIS VISIT&mdash;PAUL'S EMPLOYMENT
DURING IT.</h5>

<p>Fifteen days, if Paul is to be believed&mdash;fifteen days,
and no more,&mdash;was the length of time, during which
his intercourse with Peter continued: Gal. i. 18, that
same length of time, and no greater, it may without
much rashness be inferred, was his stay at Jerusalem.</p>

<p>These fifteen days,&mdash;or whatever, if anything
longer, was the duration of his stay in that seat of
their common religion,&mdash;in what occupations were
they employed? It is in the Acts, if anywhere, that
this question will receive its answer. It was in "disputing
against the Grecians." Acts 9:29.</p>

<p>That such should have been his occupation, is in
his situation altogether natural.</p>

<p>Of a sort of <i>partition treaty</i>, as having, at one
time, been entered into between himself and Peter,&mdash;Paul,
in his so-often mentioned letters to the Galatians,
informs us in express terms. As to the time,
which, on that occasion, he has in view,&mdash;it was, according
to appearance, not the time of <i>this</i> his first
visit, but of the third. At that third visit, the treaty
was, at any rate, either entered into for the first time,
or confirmed: receiving, at the same time, what was
on both sides agreed upon, as an amendment requisite
to add to it, in respect of clearness, correctness,
or completeness.</p>

<p>But, at this visit, it seems altogether natural, that,
with more or less of these same qualities, a treaty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
this sort took place. By the sort of relation, produced
between them, by the state of interests,&mdash;the
existence of an agreement of this sort seems sufficiently
probabilized: and, from the few words, in
which, by the author of the Acts, mention is made
of the Grecians, and of Paul's disputes with them,&mdash;the
inference receives the confirmation afforded by
<i>direct</i> evidence.</p>

<p>With the Grecians then it was, that these disputations
of Paul were held. Why with the Grecians, and
no other? The reason is no mystery. Greek was the
language of Paul: Greek, for anything that appears,
was not the language of Peter, or of any other of
the Apostles. Applying himself to the Grecians, and
to them alone,&mdash;Paul might, to any amount, have
given additional extent to his own dominion, without
subtracting anything from theirs.</p>

<p>Not productive, it should seem, of much fruit,&mdash;was
this portion, of the new Apostle's labours. No
sooner are we informed, of the boon thus offered to
these Grecian Gentiles, than comes, moreover, the
further information, that some there were, that
"went about to slay him. Which when the brethren
knew, they brought him," it is added, "to Csarea,
and sent him forth to Tarsus." Acts 9:29.</p>

<p>Meantime, those men, who went about to slay him,&mdash;who
were they? Possibly they were Grecians, if by
the disputation in question, the annoyance produced
was so intolerable to them, as to be productive of a
wish and enterprise thus flagitious: and, if the evidence
afforded by the rules of grammar be in this
case regarded as conclusive,&mdash;the pronoun <i>they</i> having
for its last possible antecedent the substantive
<i>Grecians</i>&mdash;these, and no other, must have been the
intended murderers. On the other hand, among the
heathen&mdash;the philosophical disputants of this nation,&mdash;disputations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
having any such abstractions for
their subject, were not wont to be productive, of any
such practical and flagitious consequences. Among
the heathens, moreover, it appears not, that, antecedently
to his conversion, the zeal of Paul had led
him to put any to death: on the other hand among
the Christianized Jews, his fellow-religionists, the
number of persons, of whom he had put to death
some, and in other ways plagued others, was unhappily
but too great. By the religion <i>into</i> which they
had been converted,&mdash;revenge, it is true, was not
(as in that which they were converted <i>from</i>) magnified,
but prohibited: but, the influence of it has never
been equally efficient upon all minds.</p>

<p>Be this as it may,&mdash;upon his leaving Jerusalem, it
was to the region of Syria and Cilicia, that, at this
time, he betook himself. So, in his letter to his
Galatians, he himself says, Gal. 1:21; and, by what is
said in the Acts, he is not contradicted, but confirmed.
By himself what is mentioned is&mdash;the <i>region</i>, viz.
Syria and Cilicia: by the Acts what is mentioned is&mdash;the
<i>cities</i>, viz. Csarea and Tarsus. Csarea,&mdash;whether
at that time it was in Syria or not,&mdash;was, at
any rate, little, if anything, out of the way, from
Jerusalem to Tarsus. Csarea was a town upon the
coast:&mdash;one among those maritime towns, which,
whether parts or not of Syria, are in the way between
the inland city, of Jerusalem, and the coast of Cilicia:
with which coast, by a river,&mdash;Tarsus, marked in the
map with the mark of a capital town, appears to
communicate.</p>

<p>In speaking of this change of place, the terms employed
by Paul, are general terms,&mdash;"<i>I came.</i>" By
what <i>means</i> he came, he does not mention: nor does
there appear any particular reason why he should
have mentioned them.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Acts, the account is more particular:&mdash;he
was, in a manner, forced from the one place to the
other:&mdash;he was, at any rate, <i>escorted</i>: it was by
"<i>the brethren</i>," he was so dealt with. "Which when
the brethren knew, they brought him down to
Csarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus." Acts
9:30.</p>

<p>By the brethren?&mdash;Yes.&mdash;But by what brethren?
By the general body of the Christians, or any that
belonged to it? No:&mdash;for, it was from their wrath,
that he was making his escape. No:&mdash;not by the
justly exasperated many; but by such few adherents
as, under such prodigious disadvantage, his
indefatigable artifice and energy had found means to
conciliate.</p>


<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 7.</h4>

<h5>MODE AND CAUSE OF ITS TERMINATION.</h5>

<p>In relation to this subject, we have two, and no more
than two, accounts,&mdash;both from the same pen,&mdash;that
of the historiographer in the Acts; and these two
accounts, as usual, contradictory of each other. The
first, in the order of the history, is that given by him
in his own person: Acts 9:27, 28, 29. The other, is
that given by him in the person of Paul: namely,
in the course of his supposed first-made and unpremeditated
speech,&mdash;when, on the occasion of his last
visit to Jerusalem&mdash;his Invasion Visit, he was pleading
for his life before the angry multitude. Acts 22:17,
18, 19, 20, 21.</p>

<p>Now then, let us compare the two accounts.</p>

<p>Speaking in his own person,&mdash;it is to the fear of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
certain Grecians, that the historiographer ascribes
Paul's departure for Jerusalem. In disputing with
them, he had been speaking "boldly in the name of
the Lord Jesus": and <i>thereupon</i>,&mdash;and as we are
desired to believe, <i>therefore</i>,&mdash;came certain designs
and endeavours to slay him. Designs? on the part
of whom? Answer:&mdash;on the part of those same
Grecians: cause of these designs and endeavours,
irritation, so it is intended we should suppose,&mdash;irritation,
produced in the breasts of those same
Grecians;&mdash;and produced by the dispute.</p>

<p>Now, as to the words of the historiographer, speaking
in his own person. It is immediately after the
mention of Paul's transactions with the Apostles and
the other disciples, that after saying, Acts 9:28, that
"... he was with them coming in and going out
of Jerusalem," the narrative continues thus: ver.
29; "And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord
Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians, but <i>they</i>
went about to slay him: ver. 30; Which when <i>the
brethren</i> knew, they brought him down to Csarea,
and sent him forth to Tarsus."</p>

<p>Such is the account given, of the departure of Paul
from Jerusalem, on the occasion in question&mdash;given
by the historiographer, speaking in his own person,
of the manner of the departure, and at the same time
of the cause of it. Behold now how different is
the account given, of the same matter, by the same
historiographer, in the same work, when speaking
in the person of his hero. Nothing now as to any
disputes with Grecians: nothing now of these, or any
other human beings, in the character of beings who
were angry with him, and <i>that</i> to such a degree, that,
to save his life, it was deemed necessary by his
adherents,&mdash;styled on this occasion "<i>the</i> brethren,"
to take charge of him, as we have seen, and convey
him from Jerusalem to Csarea and elsewhere.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>The case seems to be&mdash;that, between the time of
writing the account which has just been seen, and
the time for giving an account of the same transaction
in the person of the hero, as above,&mdash;a certain
difficulty presented itself to the mind of the historiographer:
and, that it is for the solution of this difficulty,
that he has recourse, to one of his sovereign
solvents&mdash;<i>a trance</i>. The difficulty seems to have been
this: The class of persons, whom, on that first visit
of his he had exasperated, were&mdash;not "<i>Grecians</i>," or
any other Gentiles, but Christians: Christians, the
whole body of them&mdash;Apostles and Disciples together:
the same class of persons, to which belonged
those who, on the occasion of this his last visit&mdash;the
<i>Invasion Visit</i>&mdash;were to such a degree exasperated,
by this fourth intrusion of his, as to be attempting
his life. How hopeless any attempt would have been,
to make them believe, that it was not by themselves,
but by a set of Heathens, that his life was threatened
on that former occasion, is sufficiently manifest.
Here then comes a demand, for a substitute, to that
cause, which, distant as the time was, could not,
however, be altogether absent from their memory:
and which, so far as it was present, could not but
heighten their exasperation:&mdash;this substitute was <i>the
trance</i>.</p>

<p>The cause of the departure is now&mdash;not the fear
of any human being, but the express command of
"<i>the Lord</i>":&mdash;a command delivered in the course,
and by means, of this same <i>trance</i>. Moreover, as if,
from such a quarter, <i>commands</i> were not sufficient of
themselves; on the present occasion, it will be seen,
they came backed by <i>reasons</i>. Was it that, as the
historiographer has been telling us in his own person,
certain Grecians were exasperated? No: but that
the persons, to whom, with Barnabas for his supporting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
witness, Acts 9:27, he had been telling his story,
gave no credit to it: so that, by a man with his reputation
in this state, nothing in the way of his business
was to be done.</p>

<p>But now let us see the text. It comes immediately
after that passage, in which Paul is made to speak
of Ananias, as giving orders to him, in the name
of the Lord: orders, concluding in these words: Acts
22:16: ... "arise, and be baptized, and wash away
thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord." This
said,&mdash;his story, as told to the multitude, continues
thus: "And it came to pass that, when I was come
again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the
temple, I was in <i>a trance</i>: And saw him saying unto
me, Make <i>haste</i>, and get thee <i>quickly</i> out of Jerusalem:
<i>for they will not receive thy testimony concerning
me</i>. And I said, Lord, they know that I
imprisoned and beat in every synagogue those that
believed on thee: And when the blood of thy martyr
Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and
consenting to his death, and kept the raiment of
them that slew him. And he said unto me, Depart:
for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.
And they gave him audience unto this word, and
then lifted up their voices and said, Away with
such a fellow from the earth; for it is not fit that
he should live."</p>

<p>It may now be seen, how useful and convenient an
implement this same trance was: how well adapted,
to the occasion on which it was employed. Taken
by itself, this story about the enraged Grecians might
serve to impose upon readers in general: but, to the
knowledge of the really enraged Christians, whose
wrath he was endeavouring to assuage,&mdash;it was not
only too palpably false to be related to them, but
too much so, to be even for a moment supposed to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
related to them: hence came the demand for the
supernatural cause. Nothing, it is evident, could be
better suited to the purpose. The assertion was of
the sort of those, which, how palpably soever untrue,
are not exposed to contradiction by direct evidence:
and which, supposing them believed, ensure universal
respect, and put all gainsayers to silence.</p>

<p>An incident not unworthy here of notice, is&mdash;the
sort of acknowledgment contained in the words&mdash;"for
they will not receive thy testimony concerning
me." In this may be seen&mdash;a confirmation of the
important fact, so fully proved on the occasion of
the first or <i>Reconciliation Visit</i>: and we see&mdash;with
what consistency and propriety, the mention of it
comes in, on the present occasion: namely, in a
speech, made to a multitude, of which, many of those,&mdash;by
whom he had been disbelieved and rejected on
that former occasion,&mdash;must of course have formed a
part.</p>

<p>Such is the fact, which, after having communicated
to us, in his own person, Acts 9:26, "they were all
afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple,"
the historiographer is frank enough to communicate
to us a second time, through the mouths of
Paul and "the Lord," the one within the other. <i>True</i>
enough this information: and, moreover, at Jerusalem,
as well when the historiographer was writing,
as when Paul was speaking, <i>notorious</i> enough: or we
should hardly have had it <i>here</i> and <i>now</i>. But, what
a truth to put into the mouth of Paul, whose title
to credence for his claim, is so effectually destroyed
by it!</p>

<p>To return to what, on the occasion of the first visit,
is said by the historiographer, in his own person,
about the Grecians. That it was false, as to the main
point,&mdash;namely, that it was by the fear of those same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
Gentiles that he was driven out of Jerusalem,&mdash;is
now, it is hoped, sufficiently evident. But, as to his
having held disputation with them,&mdash;in this there
seems not to be anything inconsistent or improbable:
and this part, supposing it true, might, in so far as
known, help to gain credence for that which was
false.</p>

<p>A circumstance&mdash;not altogether clear, nor worth
taking much trouble in the endeavour to render it
so, is&mdash;on the occasion of this dialogue, the change
made, of the supernatural vehicle, from a <i>vision</i>
into a "<i>trance</i>." Whatsoever, if any, is the difference,&mdash;they
agree in the one essential point: namely,
that it is in the power, of any man, at any time, to
have had as many of them as he pleases: hearing
and seeing, moreover, in every one of them, whatsoever
things it suits his convenience to have heard or
seen.&mdash;"I saw a vision:" or, "I was in a trance":
either postulate granted, everything whatsoever
follows.</p>

<p>This <i>trance</i>, it may be observed, is of a much
more substantial nature than any of the <i>visions</i>. By
Paul in his <i>road vision</i>,&mdash;vision as it was,&mdash;neither
<i>person</i> nor <i>thing</i>, with the exception of a quantity of
light, was seen: only a voice, <i>said to be the Lord's</i>,
heard. In this trance, the Lord is not only heard, but
seen. In those visions, that which is said to have
been heard, amounts to nothing: on the present occasion,
what is said to have been heard, is material
to the purpose, and perfectly intelligible. Not that
there could be any use in Paul's <i>actually</i> hearing of
it: for what it informed him of, was nothing more
than that which, at the very time, he was in full
experience of. But, in a situation such as his, it was
really of use to him, to be <i>thought</i> to have heard it:
and therefore it is, that, in the speech ascribed to
him, he is represented as <i>saying</i> that he heard it.</p>

<h4>SECTION 1.</h4>

<h5>AT ANTIOCH, AGABUS HAVING PREDICTED A DEARTH,
MONEY IS COLLECTED FOR THE JERUSALEM SAINTS.</h5>

<p>At his own house it was, that we last left our self-declared
Apostle: at his own birthplace&mdash;Tarsus:
what we have next to see is&mdash;what drew him from
thence.</p>

<p>All this while there were other disciples that had
not been idle. To the new religion, already was
Antioch, Antioch in Syria, become a new Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Upon the dispersion of the Jerusalem Christians,
occasioned by the judicial murder of the sainted
trustee of the poor's fund&mdash;Stephen,&mdash;some of them,
among whom were some natives of Cyprus,&mdash;in
which island was situated the property of the son of
consolation, Barnabas,&mdash;had betaken themselves to
that same island, others to that same city of Antioch
in Syria.</p>

<h5>ACTS xi. 19-24.</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>19. Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution
that arose about Stephen, travelled as far as Phenice and Cyprus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.&mdash;And
some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when
they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the
Lord Jesus.&mdash;And the hand of the Lord was with them; and a
great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.&mdash;Then tidings
of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in
Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far
as Antioch.&mdash;Who, when he came and had seen the grace of God,
was glad; and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they
would cleave unto the Lord.&mdash;For he was a good man, full of the
Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added unto the
Lord.<br /><br /></p></div>

<p>Of these, some addressed themselves exclusively
to the <i>Jews</i>: others ventured so far, as to make an
experiment upon the <i>Grecians</i>. Unfortunately, these
terms are, neither of them, wholly free from ambiguity.
By the word <i>Jews</i>, may have been meant
either Jews by <i>birth</i> and <i>abode</i>, or Jews by <i>religion</i>:
by the word <i>Grecians</i>, either Jews who, born or
dwelling within the field of quondam Grecian dominion,
used the Greek as their native language,&mdash;or
Greeks, who were such, not only by language, but
by religion. In this latter case, their lot was among
the Gentiles, and much more extraordinary and conspicuous
was the importance of the success.</p>

<p>"They which preach the Gospel, should live of the
Gospel." Such, in his own words, 1 Cor. 9:14, is
the maxim laid down by Paul, for the edification of
his Corinthian disciples. To save doubts and disputation,
he prefaces it with the assurance&mdash;"even so
hath the Lord ordained." No great need of support
from revelation, seems to attach upon a maxim
so natural, and so reasonable: from the time of the
first planting of the Gospel, it appears to have been,
as indeed it could not fail to be, universally acted
upon; saving such few exceptions as a happy union
of zeal, with sufficient pecuniary means, might render
possible.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>How, under the Apostolical aristocracy, it had
been acted upon in Jerusalem, has been seen already.
The time was now come,&mdash;for its being established,
and acted upon in Antioch.</p>

<p>At Jerusalem, under the spiritual dominion of the
Apostles, lived a man of the name of <i>Agabus</i>. Among
the endowments,&mdash;of which, in the character of <i>qualifications</i>,
a demand was by some understood to be
created, by the business of propagating the new
religion,&mdash;qualifications, a list of which, according to
his conception of it, Paul, 1 Cor. 12:10, has given
us,&mdash;was one, which, among these endowments, was
called the "<i>gift of prophecy</i>":&mdash;a gift, under which,
as under that of speech in general, particularly when
applied to occasions of importance, the faculty of
<i>prediction</i>&mdash;of forming correct judgments respecting
future contingencies&mdash;would, if not necessarily, very
frequently at least, come to be included.</p>

<p>In the instance of the <i>prophecy</i> here in question,
this same prospective faculty, it should seem, was
actually included.</p>

<p>The <i>fact</i>, for the purpose of predicting, or giving
information of which, this useful emissary was, on
the present occasion, sent from Jerusalem to Antioch,&mdash;was&mdash;that
of signifying, that there should be a
great dearth: an <i>inference</i> deduced from it, was&mdash;that,
at this same Antioch, for the relief of the
brethren at Jerusalem, <i>contributions</i> should be collected,
and sent to Jerusalem.</p>

<h5>ACTS xi. 27-30.</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>27. And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.&mdash;And
there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by
the spirit that there should be a great dearth throughout all the
world; which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.&mdash;Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send
relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judea:&mdash;Which also they did,
and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.<br /><br /></p></div>

<p>In the calamity of <i>dearth</i> may be seen one of those
events, of which&mdash;especially if the time of it be not
predesignated with too rigid an exactness&mdash;a prediction
may be hazarded,&mdash;and even by any man,&mdash;without
much risk of falling under the disgrace attached
to the appellation of <i>a false prophet</i>. Of this observation,
an exemplification seems to have been afforded,
in the present instance. With not unaccustomed
prudence,&mdash;"the spirit," by which, on this
occasion, the calamity was "signified," forbore, as
we see, from the fixation of any particular year&mdash;either
for the prophecy, or for the accomplishment
of it. "The days of Claudius Caesar" are mentioned
as the time of the accomplishment. By agreement
of all chronologists,&mdash;the duration of his reign is
stated as occupying not less than thirteen years.
Whether this same reign had then already commenced,&mdash;is
not, on this occasion, mentioned: from
the manner in which it is mentioned, the negative
seems not improbable; if so, then to find the time
which the prophecy had for finding its accomplishment
to the definite term of thirteen years, we must
add another, and that an indefinite one.</p>

<p>According to the situation, of the individuals by
whom the word is employed,&mdash;<i>worlds</i> vary in their
sizes. Of the dearth in question, the whole world,
"all the world," is, by the author of the Acts, stated
as having been the afflicted theatre: "great dearth
throughout all the world." Acts 11:28. As to the
rest of the world, we may leave it to itself. For the
purpose then and now in question, it was and is
sufficient&mdash;that two cities, Jerusalem and Antioch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
were included in it. The calamity being thus universal,&mdash;no
reason of the ordinary kind is given, or
seems discoverable&mdash;why, of any such contribution
as should come to be raised, the course should be&mdash;from
Antioch to Jerusalem, rather than from Jerusalem
to Antioch. Inquired for, however, on religious
ground,&mdash;a <i>reason</i> presents itself, without
much difficulty. What Rome became afterwards,
Jerusalem was then&mdash;the capital of <i>that world</i>, which
now, for the first time, received the name of <i>Christian</i>.
According to one of the sayings of Jesus&mdash;if
Paul, his self-appointed Apostle, is to be trusted
to&mdash;of them it was pronounced "<i>more blessed to
give than to receive</i>":<a name="FNanchor_28_31" id="FNanchor_28_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_31" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> but in the eyes of the
successors of St. Peter at all times,&mdash;and at this
time, as it should seem, in his own&mdash;it was <i>more
blessed to receive than give</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<h4>SECTION 2.</h4>

<h5>BARNABAS AND PAUL DISPATCHED WITH THE MONEY
TO JERUSALEM.</h5>

<p>Of the <i>amount</i> of the eleemosynary harvest, no intimation
is to be found. As to the <i>consequence</i> of it,
Barnabas, we see, is the man stated as having, with
obvious propriety, been chosen for the important
trust: Barnabas&mdash;of whose opulence, trustworthiness,
steadiness, and zeal, such ample proofs, not to
speak of those subsequent ones, which will be seen
in their place, had already manifested themselves.
In consequence of the information, already received
by the Mother Church in Jerusalem, of the prosperity
of the Daughter Church, Acts 11:20, 21,
planted, as above, in the capital of Syria,&mdash;this most
active of all Christian citizens had been sent to give
increase to it.</p>

<p>But, of the talents and activity of Paul, his indefatigable
supporter and powerful patron had had
full occasion to be apprized. Accordingly, without
the aid of this his not less indefatigable helper, still
was the strength of the rising church, in the eyes
of the patron, incomplete. "A prophet," says a
not ill-grounded proverb, "has no honor in his own
country." In his native city, among the witnesses
of his youth, Paul had indeed found <i>safety</i>: but, as
the nature of the case manifests, in a circle, from
which respect stood excluded by familiarity, safety
had not been accompanied with <i>influence</i>: and, in
eyes such as those of Paul, safety without influence
was valueless. Under these circumstances,&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
patron, going to Tarsus in person in quest of his
proteg, could not naturally find much difficulty in
regaining possession of him, and bringing with him
the so highly-valued prize, on his return to Antioch.
"Then," says the Acts, 11:25, 26, "departed Barnabas
to Tarsus, for to seek Saul: And when he had
found him, he brought him unto Antioch."</p>

<p>At this place, with their united powers, they had
been carrying on their operations for the space of
a twelvemonth, when the petition for pecuniary assistance
was received there.</p>

<p>As for Paul,&mdash;from the moment of his conversion,
notwithstanding the ill success of his first attempt,&mdash;the
prime object of his ambition&mdash;the situation of
President of the Christian Commonwealth&mdash;had
never quitted its hold on his concupiscence. Occasions,
for renewing the enterprise, were still watched
for with unabated anxiety:&mdash;a more favourable one
than the one herein question, could not have presented
itself to his fondest wishes. The entire produce,
of the filial bounty of the Daughter Church, was
now to be poured into the bosom of the necessitous
Mother. For the self-destined head of that rising
Church, two more acceptable occupations, than those
which one and the same occasion brought to him,
could not have been found:&mdash;First, the collection of
the contributions;&mdash;and then the conveying of them,
to the place of their destination. Of the labours of
such agents, in such circumstances, the success, we
are told, they found, was a natural result. "Then,"
says the Acts 11:29, 30, "Then the disciples, every
one according to his ability, determined to send
relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judea:&mdash;Which
also they did; and sent it to the elders by
the hands of Barnabas and Saul." Thus much as
to the <i>public</i> purpose. Very different was the lot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
Paul's <i>personal</i> project. What the elders could not
have any objection to the receipt of, was&mdash;the money.
But, what they had an insuperable objection to, was&mdash;the
receipt of the yoke of this their outwardly-converted,
but once already rejected, persecutor.
This second enterprise,&mdash;though still under the same
powerful leader, and produced by such flattering
prospects,&mdash;succeeded no better than the first. Five-and-twenty
verses after, we are told of the <i>termination</i>
of this their second Jerusalem visit; and this
is all we hear of it: "And Barnabas and Saul," says
the Acts 12:25, "returned from Jerusalem, when
they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with
them John, whose surname was Mark." This same
John Mark they got by their expedition: and this, for
anything that appears, was all they got by it.</p>

<p>Between the mention of their arrival at Jerusalem,
and the mention of their departure from thence,&mdash;comes
the episode about Peter:&mdash;his incarceration
and liberation under Herod; and the extraordinary
death of the royal prosecutor,&mdash;of which, in its place.
As to the interval,&mdash;what the length of it was, and in
what manner, by Paul, under the wing of the Son
of Consolation, it was occupied,&mdash;are points, on
which we are left altogether in the dark: as also,
whether the <i>time</i> of these adventures of Peter, the
<i>mention</i> of which stands inserted between the mention
of the two occurrences in the history of Paul,
was comprised in that same interval.</p>

Rites to Heathen Converts to the Religion of
Jesus.</i></h3>


<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 1.</h4>

<h5>OCCASION OF THIS VISIT.</h5>

<p>We come now to the transaction, on the occasion of
which, the grand object of Paul's ambition received,
in part, its accomplishment: namely, that, by which,&mdash;though
without any such popular election as, in the
instance of Matthias, had been necessary to constitute
a man an associate to the Apostles,&mdash;he was, in
some sort, taken by them into fellowship, and admitted,
with their consent, into a participation of
their labours.</p>

<p>This occasion was&mdash;the dispute, which, in the
Syrian Antioch, took place, according to the author
of the Acts, on the question&mdash;whether, under the
religion of Jesus, circumcision was necessary to salvation:
a question, in which,&mdash;whether explicitly or
no,&mdash;was implicitly, it should seem, and perhaps
inextricably, understood to be involved, the so much
wider question&mdash;whether, under that same new religion,
the old ceremonial law should, in any part of
it, be regarded as necessary.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>On this same occasion, two important subjects
present themselves to view at the same time: the one,
a question of <i>doctrine</i> relative to circumcision, as
above; the other, a question about <i>jurisdiction</i>, as
between Paul on the one part, and Peter, with or
without the rest of the Apostles.</p>

<p>As to what concerns the debate about circumcision,
we have no other evidence than the statement of
the author of the Acts.</p>

<p>As to what concerns the jurisdiction question, we
have the evidence of Paul himself, as contained in
his letter to the Galatian converts: and an original
letter, howsoever dubious the correctness of the
author in respect of matters of fact, is more trustworthy
than a multitude of anonymous narratives.<a name="FNanchor_29_32" id="FNanchor_29_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_32" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>In respect of the progress made by the religion of
Jesus,&mdash;Antioch, it has already been observed&mdash;the
Syrian Antioch&mdash;had become a second Jerusalem;
and, so far as concerned the Gentiles at large, its
maritime situation gave to it a convenience, that was
not shared with it by that inland city.</p>

<p>At the time here in question,&mdash;the Gentiles had
received more or less of instruction, from three
different sets of teachers:&mdash;1. from the disciples who
had been driven from Jerusalem by the tragical
death of Saint Stephen; 2. from Saint Peter, principally
on the occasion of the excursion made by him
to Lydda, Saron, Joppa, and Csarea; and 3. from
Paul and Barnabas, on the occasion, and by the
means, of the long tour, made by them for that
special purpose, as above.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>
<p>At this maritime metropolis of the faith, the new
religion was spreading itself,&mdash;and, as far at least
as depended on exemption from all disturbance
from without, in a state of peace and tranquility;&mdash;when,
by a set of <i>nameless</i> men from Judea,&mdash;if to
the author of the Acts credit is to be given on this
point, for by him no mention is made of any one
of their names,&mdash;the harmony of the Church was
disturbed.</p>

<p>Converts as they were to the religion of Jesus,
yet,&mdash;in their view of the matter, if the author of the
Acts is to be believed, without circumcision, no salvation
was to be had.</p>

<p>By Paul it is said, "they came from James," Gal.
2:12, which is as much as to say that they were
sent by James: and accordingly, when James's
speech is seen, by him will these scruples of theirs
be seen advocated.</p>

<p>If the Gospel history, as delivered by the Evangelists,
is to be believed,&mdash;nothing could be more
inconsistent, on many occasions with the practice,
and at length with the direct precepts, of Jesus, than
this deference to the Mosaic law: if human prudence
is to be regarded,&mdash;nothing could be more impolitic&mdash;nothing
more likely to narrow, instead of extending,
the dominion of the Church. On this principle, no
man who was not born a Jew, could be a Christian
without first becoming a Jew, without embracing the
Mosaic law; and thus loading himself with two different,
and mutually inconsistent, sets of obligations.</p>

<p>From Paul, this conceit,&mdash;as was natural,&mdash;experienced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
a strenuous resistance. No recognition as yet
had Paul received, from the body of the Apostles. In
Jerusalem, for anything that appears,&mdash;though this
was at least seventeen years after the death of Jesus&mdash;they
remained alive&mdash;all of them:&mdash;at any rate the
two chiefs of them, if Paul is to be believed, who,
Gal. i. 19, says he saw them, namely, Saint Peter
"and James, the Lord's brother": which two, he
says, he saw, out of a number, the rest of whom, he
studiously assures his Galatians that he did not see:
though by his historiographer, Acts 15:4, by his all-comprehensive
expression, "<i>the Apostles</i>," we are
desired to believe, that he saw all of them.<a name="FNanchor_30_33" id="FNanchor_30_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_33" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Whichever
be the truth,&mdash;at Jerusalem, the metropolis
of Judaism, no employment could, under these
circumstances, be reasonably expected for Paul:
whereas, <i>out</i> of Judea,&mdash;wherever the language of
Greece was the mother tongue, or familiarly spoken,&mdash;the
advantage, which, in every address to the Gentiles,
he would have over those unlearned Jews, was
universally manifest.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>
<p>Such, however, were the impressions, made by
these unnamed manufacturers and disseminators of
scruples, who, if Paul is to be believed, came from
James the brother of our Lord&mdash;that, by the whole
Church, as it is called, of Antioch, a determination
was taken&mdash;to send to Jerusalem, to the Apostles
and the Elders that were associated with them, a
numerous mission, headed by Paul and Barnabas,
who are the only two persons named. Accordingly,
out they set, "after having been brought on their
way," says the author of the Acts, 15:3, "by the
<i>Church</i>," which is as much as to say, by the whole
fraternity of Christians there established.</p>

<h5>THE DELEGATES HOW RECEIVED.&mdash;COUNCIL OF
APOSTLES AND ELDERS.</h5>


<p>Against the pretensions of a man thus supported,
vain, on the part of the original and real Apostles,
would have been any attempt, to resist the pretensions
of this their self-constituted rival: they, Barnabas
and Paul, were received, says the author of
the Acts, of the Church and of the Apostles and
Elders.<a name="FNanchor_31_34" id="FNanchor_31_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_34" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>
<p>Arrived at Jerusalem, Paul and Barnabas told
their own story&mdash;related their adventures and experiences&mdash;declared,
to use the language of the Acts
15:4, all things that God had done unto them.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the utmost exertion of Paul's
ever-ready eloquence,&mdash;some, it is stated, there were,
who, believers as, in a certain sort, they were in the
religion of Jesus,&mdash;were not to be persuaded, to give
up so much as a single tittle of the Mosaic law: these
were, as it was natural they should be, of the sect
of Pharisees. "There rose up," says the Acts 15:5,
"certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed,
saying that it was needful to circumcise them (the
Gentiles), and to command them to keep the law
of Moses."</p>

<p>Of these private discussions, the result was&mdash;the
convocation of an assembly of the managing body,
in which, associated with the Apostles, we find others&mdash;under
the name of <i>Elders</i>.</p>

<p>How, on an occasion, on which the proposed subject
of determination was a question of such cardinal
importance to the religion of Jesus;&mdash;how it should
have come to pass, that the Apostles, to whom alone,
and by whom alone, the whole tenor of the acts and
sayings of Jesus had been made known&mdash;made known
by an uninterrupted habit of exclusive intimacy, and
especially during the short but momentous interval
between his resurrection and ascension;&mdash;how it
should have happened, that, to the Apostles, any
other persons not possessed of these first of all titles
to credence and influence, should have come to be
associated,&mdash;is not mentioned. Upon no other authority
than that of this author, are we to believe
it to be true? On the supposition of its being true,&mdash;there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
seems to be, humanly speaking, but one way
to account for it. That which the Apostles, and they
alone, <i>could</i> contribute to the cause, was&mdash;the authority
and the evidence resulting from that peculiar
intimacy: what they could <i>not</i> contribute was&mdash;money
and influence derived from ordinary and external
sources: to the exclusive possession of these latter
titles to regard, will, therefore, it should seem, be to
be ascribed, supposing it credited, the circumstance
of an incorporation otherwise so incongruous.</p>

<p>"Received," say the Acts 15:4, they were.&mdash;But
by whom received?&mdash;By the Church, by the Apostles,
by the Elders, says that same history in that same
place. By <i>the</i> Apostles: to wit&mdash;so as any one would
conclude&mdash;by <i>all</i> the Apostles&mdash;by the whole fellowship
of Apostles.</p>

<p>Whether in any, and, if so, in what degree that conclusion
is correct, we have no determinate means of
knowing.</p>

<p>If, however, it was so to the utmost,&mdash;nothing appears
in favor of the notion, that between Paul on the
one part, and the Apostles and their disciples on the
other, there existed at this time any real harmony.
For, in what character was it that he made his appearance?
In that of a commissioned envoy, from the
whole body of the Church, established in that station,
which was next in importance to Jerusalem, to which
he was sent. And who was it that, at that time, as
on both the former times, he, Paul, had in his company?
Still his constant patron and associate Barnabas&mdash;the
munificent friend and patron of that church
which he was visiting&mdash;the indefatigable Barnabas.</p>

<p>By Paul himself, in his Epistle to the Galatians, 2:9,
10, 11, the idea of any such extensive cordiality,&mdash;say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
rather of cordiality to any the smallest extent,&mdash;is
pretty plainly negatived.<a name="FNanchor_32_35" id="FNanchor_32_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_35" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> On that occasion, it
was that of the Partition Treaty, what his interest
required was&mdash;that, on the part of the Apostles and
their disciples, the concurrence given to it, should
appear as extensive as possible. If then they had
all of them, really and personally concurred in it,&mdash;or
even if the contrary had not been notorious, this
is the conception which he would have been forward
to convey and inculcate. No such notion, however,
does he venture to convey. When speaking of them
in general terms&mdash;of no affection on either side, more
kindly than that of ill humor, does he give any intimation.
Gal. 2:6. "Of those who seemed to be
somewhat, whatsoever they were, it maketh no
matter to me: God accepted no man's person: for
they who seemed to be somewhat in conference
added nothing to me."</p>

<p>When, again, he comes to speak of the sort of intercourse,
such as it was, which he had with the Apostles,&mdash;who
are the persons that he speaks of? All the
Apostles? the body of the Apostles in general?&mdash;No:
James, Cephas, the Hebrew name of which Peter is
a translation, and John: these three, and no more.
These are the men, whom, to him Paul and his protector
Barnabas in conjunction, he on that same occasion
speaks of, as "giving the right hand of fellowship:"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
to wit, for the purpose of the Partition
Treaty, the terms of which immediately follow.</p>

<p>And, even of these men, in what way does he
speak? As of men "who seemed to be pillars:" so
that, as to what concerned the rest of the Apostles, he
found himself reduced to speak no otherwise than by
conjecture. And this same "right hand of fellowship"&mdash;what
was their inducement for giving it?&mdash;It
was, says he, that "they perceived the grace that
was given unto me": <i>i.e.</i>, in plain language, and ungrounded
pretension apart,&mdash;the power, which they
saw he had, of doing mischief:&mdash;of passing, from the
character of a jealous and restless rival, into that of
a declared enemy: into that character, in which he had
originally appeared, and with such disastrous effect.</p>

<p>Immediately after this comes the mention of the
visit, made by Peter to Antioch: and therefore it is,
that, no sooner is Peter&mdash;that chief of the Apostles of
Jesus&mdash;mentioned,&mdash;than he is mentioned, as a man
whom this Paul "withstood to his face, because he
was to be blamed." Gal. 2:11.</p>

<p>Peter was to be blamed: those other Jews that were
come to Antioch from James&mdash;they were to be blamed.
Barnabas, under whose powerful protection,&mdash;by the
Church at Jerusalem, her justly odious persecutor
had, at three different times, been endured,&mdash;he too
was to be blamed. He too was, at that time, to be
blamed; and, as will be seen presently after, openly
quarrelled with; and, if on this point the Acts are to
be believed, parted with. Acts 15:39. "And the
contention was so sharp between them, that they
departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas
took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<h4>SECTION 3.</h4>

<h5>DEBATES&mdash;COURSE CARRIED BY JAMES AGAINST PETER.</h5>

<p>Of what passed at this assembly, the only account
we have&mdash;the account given to us by the author of the
Acts&mdash;is curious:&mdash;curious at any rate; and whether
it be in every particular circumstance true or not,&mdash;in
so far as it can be depended upon, instructive.<a name="FNanchor_33_36" id="FNanchor_33_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_36" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>
<p>We have the persons mentioned as having spoken:
they are, in the order in which they are here enumerated,
these four:&mdash;to wit, Peter, Barnabas, Paul and
James. Of the speech of Peter, the particulars are
given: so likewise of that of James: of Barnabas and
Paul, nothing more than the topic.</p>

<p>Against the Mosaic law <i>in toto</i>, we find Peter; and
such contribution as he is represented as furnishing
to this side of the cause in the shape of argument.
On the same side, were Barnabas and Paul: what
they furnished was matter of fact:&mdash;namely, in the
language of the Acts, "what miracles and wonders
God had wrought among the Gentiles by them:"&mdash;in
plain language, the success they had met with
among the Gentiles.</p>

<p>On this question, on the side of the chief of the
Apostles, were&mdash;the manifest interest of the religion
of Jesus as to extent of diffusion,&mdash;the authority derived
from situation,&mdash;the express command of Jesus
as delivered in the Gospel history,&mdash;and Jesus' own
practice: not to speak of the inutility and unreasonableness
of the observances themselves. Yet, as far
as appears from the author of the Acts,&mdash;of these arguments,
conclusive as they would or at least should
have been,&mdash;it appears not that any use was made:
the success, he spoke of as having been experienced
by himself among the Gentiles,&mdash;in this may be seen
the sole argument employed in Peter's speech. Thus,&mdash;in
so far as this report is to be believed,&mdash;thus,
upon their own respective achievements, did,&mdash;not
only Paul but Peter,&mdash;rest, each of them, the whole
strength of the cause.</p>

<p>Spite of reason, religion, and Jesus, the victory is
in this account, given to James&mdash;to Jesus' kinsman,
James. The motion is carried: the course proposed,
is a sort of middle course&mdash;a sort of compromise. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
the hands of Gentile proselytes, in deference to the
Mosaic law, abstinence from four things is required:
namely, meats offered to idols, blood, things
strangled: these, and the irregularities of the sexual
appetite,&mdash;whatsoever they were, that were meant
by the word, rendered into English by the word <i>fornication</i>.</p>

<p>If any such decision were really come to,&mdash;by nothing
but necessity&mdash;necessity produced by the circumstances
of place and time&mdash;will it be found excusable.
Abstinence from food killed in the way of
sacrifice to heathen gods, on the occasion of public
sacrifices: yes; for, for such food, little relish could
remain, on the part of persons devoted to the religion
of Jesus: from fornication, yes; for, for a sacrifice
in this shape, even among the Gentiles, some
preparation had been made by stoicism. But, as to
blood and things strangled,<a name="FNanchor_34_37" id="FNanchor_34_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_37" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> that is to say, animals
so slaughtered as to have more blood left in their carcasses
than the Mosaic law would allow to be left in
them&mdash;animals slaughtered otherwise than in the
Jewish manner,&mdash;thus forbidding teachings of the
religion of Jesus, to eat a meal furnished by Gentile
hands,&mdash;this, as above observed, was depriving them
of their most favourable opportunities, for carrying
their pious and beneficent purposes into effect, by
adding to the number of believers.</p>

<p>Altogether remarkable is the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'cosideration'">consideration</ins>, upon
the face of it, by which, if the historian is to be believed,
this decision was produced. "For Moses of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
old time hath in every city them that preach him,
being read in synagogues every sabbath day,"
Acts 15:21. "May be so: but what if he has? what is
that to the purpose? Good, if the question were about
the Jews: but, it is <i>not</i> about the Jews: the Gentiles,
and they only, are the subjects of it. And the Gentiles&mdash;what
know or care <i>they</i> about Moses? what is
it that is to send <i>them</i> into the synagogues, to hear
anything that is "read in synagogues"?</p>

<p>By this imaginary abstinence from blood,&mdash;for,
after all, by no exertion of Mosaic ingenuity could
the flesh ever be completely divested of the blood
that had circulated in it,&mdash;of this perfectly useless
prohibition, what would be the effect?&mdash;Not only to
oppose obstacles, to the exertions of Christian teachers,
in their endeavors to make converts among the
Gentiles,&mdash;but, on the part of the Gentiles themselves
to oppose to them a needless difficulty, in the way of
their conversion, by rendering it impossible for them,
consistently with the observance of this prohibition,
to associate with their unconverted friends and families
at convivial hours. Thus much as to what concerns
the Gentiles.<a name="FNanchor_35_38" id="FNanchor_35_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_38" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Since, and from that time, the religion of Jesus has
spread itself:&mdash;we all see to what extent. Spread itself:
and by what means? By means of the decision
thus fathered upon the Apostles? Upon the Apostles,
the Elders, and the whole Church?&mdash;No: but in spite
of it, and by the neglect of it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>
<p>Charged with a letter, containing this decision,
did Paul, together with his friend Barnabas, return
from Jerusalem,&mdash;if the author of the Acts is to be
believed,&mdash;to the society of Christian converts, by
which he had been sent thither: charged with this
letter, carrying with it the authority of the whole fellowship
of the Apostles. Paul himself&mdash;he Paul&mdash;what
sort of regard did he pay to it? <i>He wrote
against it with all his might.</i> No more Jewish rites!
No more Mosaic law! Such is the cry, that animates
the whole body of those writings of his which have
reached us.</p>

<h4>SECTION 4.</h4>

<h5>RESULT, SUPPOSED APOSTOLIC DECREE AND LETTER TO
ANTIOCH, WHICH, PER ACTS, PAUL CIRCULATES.</h5>

<p>Of a decision, agreed upon and pronounced to the
above effect&mdash;a decision expressed by a decree;&mdash;and
of a copy of that decree, included in and prefaced by
a letter addressed to the saints at Antioch,&mdash;were
Paul and Barnabas, along with others who were associated
with them, on their return to that city, the
bearers:&mdash;that is to say, if, as to these matters, credence
is given, to the statement, made by the author
of the Acts; by whom the alleged decree and letter
are given, in words, which, according to him, were
their very words:&mdash;these words are those which follow:</p>

<h5>ACTS 15:22 to 32.</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>22. Then pleased it the Apostles and Elders, with the whole church,
to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch, with Paul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
and Barnabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren.&mdash;And they
wrote letters by them after this manner: The Apostles and elders,
and brethren, <i>send</i> greeting unto the brethren which are of the
Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.&mdash;Forasmuch as we have
heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with
words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye <i>must</i> be circumcised, and
keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:&mdash;It seemed
good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men
unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,&mdash;Men that have
hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.&mdash;We
have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the
same things by mouth.&mdash;For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and
to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;&mdash;That
ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and
from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep
yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.&mdash;So when they were
dismissed, they came to Antioch; and when they had gathered the
multitude together, they delivered the epistle.&mdash;<i>Which</i> when they
had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.&mdash;And Judas and Silas,
being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many
words, and confirmed <i>them</i>.<br /><br /></p></div>

<p>Supposing it genuine,&mdash;a most curious, important
and interesting document, this letter and decree must
be allowed to be. Supposing it genuine: and, in favor
of its genuineness, reasons present themselves,
which, so long as they remain unopposed, and no preponderating
reasons in support of the contrary opinion
are produced, must decide our judgment.</p>

<p>Not long after the account of the acceptance given
at Antioch to this decision,&mdash;comes that of a conjunct
missionary excursion from that place made by Paul,
with Timotheus, and perhaps Silas, for his companion.
At the very commencement of this excursion&mdash;if,
in the decree spoken of, this decree is to be understood
as included; and there seems no reason why it
should not be, they are represented as taking an active
part in the distribution of it. Acts 16:4. "And
says the historian, as they" (Paul, &amp;c.) "went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
through the cities, they delivered them the decrees
for to keep, that were ordained of the Apostles and
Elders that were at Jerusalem."</p>

<p>That, by Paul, this token, of association with the
Apostles, should at that time be exhibited and made
manifest, seems altogether natural. It affords a further
proof, of the need, which, at that period of his
labors, he regarded himself as having, of the appearance&mdash;the
outward signs at least&mdash;of a connection
with the Apostles.</p>

<p>True, it is, that the persuasion of any such need is
altogether inconsistent with that independence,
which, in such precise and lofty terms, we have seen
him declaring in his Epistle to his Galatians,&mdash;is sufficiently
manifest. But, in the current chronology, the
date, ascribed to that Epistle, is by five years posterior,
to the date ascribed to the commencement of this
excursion: date of the excursion, A.D. 53; date of the
Epistle, A.D. 58: difference, five years: and five years
are not too great a number of years, for the experience
of success and prosperity, to have raised to so
high a pitch, the temperature of his mind.<a name="FNanchor_36_39" id="FNanchor_36_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_39" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Even before this time, we find him even outstretching
the concessions, which, in that decree, in the case
of the Gentiles, in compliance with the scruples of the
Jewish disciples they had to deal with, we have been
seeing made by the Apostles, in favor of the Mosaic
law. Abstinence&mdash;from meat offered to idols, from
blood, from things strangled, and from fornication&mdash;composed
all the Mosaic observances exacted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
that decree. To these, he, in his practice, at this time,
added another, and <i>that</i>, in respect of extent, in a
prodigious degree a more important one: to wit, the
submitting to circumcision. For, to this painful observance,&mdash;in
which a submission to all the other Mosaic
observances was implied,&mdash;he had already subjected
his new convert Timotheus, whom, in this excursion,
in addition to Silas, he took with him for a
companion. Born of a Greek father as he was,&mdash;adult
as he was,&mdash;he took him, says the historian, and
circumcised him. Circumcised him&mdash;and why?&mdash;"<i>Because
of the Jews, which were in those quarters.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_37_40" id="FNanchor_37_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_40" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>
The cause of this contrariety lies not far beneath the surface.
Paul had one object in view; his historiographer another. In the
two passages, they wrote at distant times, and with different purposes.
In his address to his Galatian disciples, Paul's object was
to magnify his own importance at the expense of that of the Apostles:
to establish the persuasion, not only of his independence of them,
but of his superiority over them. The generality of them were
not worth his notice; but having some business to settle with them,
Peter, the chief of them, he "went" to see, and James, as being
"the Lord's brother," he vouchsafed to see. On that particular
occasion, such was the conception which Paul was labouring to produce:
and such, accordingly, was his discourse. As for the historiographer,
his object was, of course, throughout, to place the importance
of his hero on as high a ground as possible. But, in this view,
when once Paul had come to a settlement with the Apostles, the
more universal the acceptance understood to have been received
by him&mdash;received from the whole body of Christians, and from those
their illustrious leaders in particular,&mdash;the better adapted to this his
historiographer's general purposes would be the conception thus
conveyed: accordingly they were received, he says, "of the Church,
and the Apostles, and Elders."</p></div>

the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise
them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.&mdash;And

up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a
good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by
my mouth should hear the word of the Gospel and believe.&mdash;And
God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the
Holy Ghost, even as <i>he did</i> unto us;&mdash;And put no difference between

tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which
neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?&mdash;But we believe that
through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved,
even as they.&mdash;Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience
to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders
God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.&mdash;And after they had
held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brethren,
hearken unto me:&mdash;Simon hath declared how God at the first did
visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.&mdash;And
to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,&mdash;After
this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of
David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins
thereof, and I will set it up:&mdash;That the residue of men might seek
after the Lord, and all the Gentiles upon whom my name is called,
saith the Lord, who doeth all these things.&mdash;Known unto God
are all his works from the beginning of the world.&mdash;Wherefore
my sentence is,&mdash;that we trouble not them, which from among the
Gentiles are turned to God:&mdash;But that we write unto them, that they
abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from
things strangled, and from blood.&mdash;For Moses of old time hath in
every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues
every sabbath day."</p></div>

seems to have been rather for explanation than as a separate ordinance.
Of strangling, instead of bleeding in the Jewish style,&mdash;what
the effect would be, other than that of retaining blood, which
the Mosaic ordinance required should be let out, is not very apparent.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_35_38" id="Footnote_35_38"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35_38"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> Another observation there is that applies even to the Jews.
By Moses were all these several things forbidden. True: but so
were a vast multitude of other things, from, which (after the exceptions
here in question) the prohibition is, by this decision, taken
off. These things, still proposed to be prohibited, as often as they
entered a synagogue, they would hear prohibited: but, so would
they all those other things, which, by this decision, are left free.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_36_39" id="Footnote_36_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36_39"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> In the account of this excursion, Galatia&mdash;now mentioned for
the first time in the Acts,&mdash;is mentioned, in the number of the countries,
which, in the course of it, he visited. It stands fourth: the
preceding places being Derbe, Lystra, Iconium and Phrygia. Acts
16:1 to 6. In Acts 18:23, "He ... went over [all] <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Galacia'">Galatia</ins> ...

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_37_40" id="Footnote_37_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37_40"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> Acts 16:1 to 3. Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and
behold, a certain disciple was there named Timotheus, the son of a
certain woman, which was a Jewess and believed: but his father
was a Greek:&mdash;Which was well reported of by the brethren that
were at Lystra and Iconium.&mdash;Him would Paul have to go forth
to him, and took and circumcised him, because of the Jews which
were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a
Greek.</p></div></div>

<h5>GALATIANS ii. 1 to 16.</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with
Barnabas, and took Titus with <i>me</i> also.&mdash;And I went up by revelation,
and communicated unto them that Gospel which I preach
among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation,
lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.&mdash;But neither
Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:&mdash;and
that because of false brethren unawares brought in,
who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ
Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage.&mdash;To whom we gave
place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the Gospel
might continue with you.&mdash;But of those who seemed to be somewhat,
whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth
no man's person: for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference
added nothing to me;&mdash;but contrariwise, when they saw that the
gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, <i>as the gospel</i>
of the circumcision <i>was</i> unto Peter;&mdash;For he that wrought effectually
in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty
in me toward the Gentiles:&mdash;and when James, Cephas, and John,
who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto
me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship;
that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.&mdash;Only
they would that we should remember the poor; the same which
I also was forward to do.&mdash;But <i>when Peter was come to Antioch,
I withstood him to the face</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
because he was to be blamed.&mdash;For
before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles:
but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself,
fearing them which were of the circumcision.&mdash;And the other Jews
dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was
carried away with their dissimulation.&mdash;But when I saw that they
walked not uprightly according to the truth of the Gospel, I said
unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the
manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou
the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?&mdash;We who are Jews by nature,
and not sinners of the Gentiles,&mdash;knowing that a man is not justified
by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we
have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith
of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the
law shall no flesh be justified.<br /><br /></p></div>

<p>So much for the question about Jewish rites.</p>

<p>We come now to the state of affairs between Paul
and Peter. Concerning this, we have little, as hath
been seen, from the author of the Acts: from Paul
himself, not much: but what there is of it is of prime
importance.</p>

<p>On this occasion, to judge from the account given
in the Acts,&mdash;between Paul and Peter, all was harmony.
In their principles, in their speeches, they
may be seen pleading on the same side: arguing, and
arguing in vain, both of them against the superior
influence of James: of that James, of whose written
works, in comparison of those we have from Paul,
we have so little. But presently, on one side at least,&mdash;we
shall see contention&mdash;preserving contention&mdash;and
rival ambition, for the cause of it.</p>

<p>In this pregnant and instructive letter,&mdash;Paul's
second letter to his Galatians,&mdash;the authenticity of
which seems to be altogether out of the reach of
doubt,&mdash;among the particulars, that bear relation to
this the third visit, the following are those, by which
the greatest share of attention seems demanded at
our hands.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>In the first place, let us view them in the order in
which they <i>stand</i>: that done, the degree of <i>importance</i>
may determine the order in which they are
<i>considered</i>.</p>

<p>1. Fourteen is the number of years, between this
third visit of his to Jerusalem, reckoning either from
the first of his visits made to that same holy place
after his conversion, or from his departure from Damascus
after his return thither from Arabia.</p>

<p>2. On this journey of his to Jerusalem, he has with
him not only Barnabas, as mentioned in the Acts, but
<i>Titus</i>, of whom no mention is there made.</p>

<p>3. It is by revelation, that this journey of his was
undertaken.</p>

<p>4. The Gospel, which he then and there preaches,
is a Gospel of his own.</p>

<p>5. Private at the same time, and for reasons thereupon
given, is his mode of communicating it.</p>

<p>6. Titus, though at his disposal, he leaves uncircumcised.</p>

<p>7. <i>False brethren</i> is the appellation he bestows
upon those, who, on this occasion, standing up for
the Mosaic law, give occasion to this debate.</p>

<p>8. Elders, Apostles, kinsmen of Jesus,&mdash;be they
who they may,&mdash;he, Paul, is not on this occasion a
man to give place to any such persons: to give place
by <i>subjection</i>: say rather in the way of <i>subordination</i>.</p>

<p>9. Unnamed are the persons, on whom the vituperation
he discharges, is poured forth. Thus much
only is said of them: namely, verse 12, that they
"came from James," the brother of our Lord. Contemptuous
throughout is the manner in which he
speaks of all those persons whom he does not name.
Quere, Who are they, to whom, in everything that
goes before that same verse, he is alluding? It seems
from thence, that it was with James, from whom they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
received support, that those scruples of theirs, out
of which sprung these differences and negotiations,
originated.</p>

<p>10. Leaving the Jews to Peter&mdash;he claims to himself
as his own the whole population of the Gentiles.</p>

<p>11. To this effect, an explicit agreement was actually
entered into; parties, he and Barnabas of the
one part; James, Peter, by his Hebrew surname of
Cephas, and John, of the other part.</p>

<p>12. Of this agreement, one condition was&mdash;that, of
such pecuniary profit, as should be among the fruits
of the labors of Paul among the Gentiles, a part
should be remitted, to be at the disposal of Peter.</p>

<p>13. Paul, at the time of this visit, stood up against
Peter.</p>

<p>14. The cause, of his doing so, was&mdash;an alleged
weakness and inconsistency in the conduct of Peter,
and his gaining to his side&mdash;not only Jews of inferior
account, but Barnabas.</p>

<p>15. The weakness and inconsistency consisted in
this: viz: that whereas he himself had been in use to
act with the Gentiles, yet after the arrival at Antioch
of those who came from James at Jerusalem,&mdash;he
from fear of the Jewish converts, not only ceased to
eat with the Gentiles, but to the extent of his influence
forced the Gentile converts to live after the
manner of the Jews.</p>

<p>16. On the occasion of this his dispute with Peter,
he gave it explicitly as his opinion,&mdash;that, to a convert
to the religion of Jesus, Jew or Gentile,&mdash;observance
of the Mosaic law would, as to everything
peculiar to it, be useless, not to say worse than useless,
Gal. 2:16, "for by the works of the law shall no
"flesh be justified."</p>

<p>1. As to his place in relation to the Apostles. His
was not inferior to anybody's: upon terms altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
equal did he treat with the Apostles: in and by the
first partition treaty,&mdash;he, with Barnabas for his colleague,&mdash;Barnabas,
from whom, according to the
Acts, he afterwards separated,&mdash;obtains the whole
of the Gentile world for the field of their labors.
Thus elevated, according to his account of the matter,
was the situation, occupied by him on the occasion
of this his third visit to Jerusalem, in comparison
of what it had been at the time of his first,&mdash;and,
to all appearance, at the time of the second. At the
time of his first visit, the Apostles,&mdash;all but Peter
and James, upon which two Barnabas forced him,&mdash;turned
their backs upon him: upon his second visit,
none of them, as far as appears, had anything to do
with him: now, upon his third visit, they deal with
him upon equal terms: and now, not only Peter
and James, but John, are stated as having intercourse
with him.</p>

<p>2. Of this partition treaty, important as it is, no
mention is to be found in the Acts. From first to
last,&mdash;in the account given in the Acts, no such figure
does he make as in his own. In the Acts, of the
speech of Peter, and even of that of James, the substance
is reported: of Paul's, nothing more than the
subject: viz. his own achievements among the Gentiles:
against Paul's opinion, as well as Peter's, the
compromise, moved by James, is represented as carried.</p>

<p>3. As to the cause, or occasion, of his third visit to
Jerusalem. In the account given in the Acts, it is
particularly and clearly enough explained. It is in
conjunction with Barnabas that he goes thither: both
of them, to confer with the Apostles and elders, on
the subject of the notion, entertained by numbers
among the Jewish converts, that, by conversion to
the religion of Jesus, they were not set free from any
of the obligations imposed by the law of Moses.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>Of this commission,&mdash;creditable as it could not but
have been to him,&mdash;Paul, in his account of the matter,
as given to the Galatians, makes not the least
mention. No: it is not from men on this occasion nor
on others, it is not from men, that he received his authority,
but from God: it is by revelation, that is,
immediately from God, and by a sort of miracle.</p>

<p>4. What, in obedience to this revelation, he was to
do, and did accordingly, was,&mdash;the preaching of a
gospel of his own; a gospel which as yet he had not
preached to any body but the Gentiles. Preaching?
how and where? in an assembly of the whole body of
the believers in Jesus, the Apostles themselves included?
No: but privately, and only to the leading
men among them: "to them which were of reputation."</p>

<p>A gospel of his own? Yes: that he did. Further
on, it will be seen what it was: a Gospel, of which, as
far as appears from the evangelists, no traces are to
be found, in anything said by Jesus: especially, if
what, on that occasion, he, Paul, taught by word of
mouth at Antioch, agreed with what we shall find him
teaching in his Epistles.</p>

<p>5. "False brethren unawares brought in, who
came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have
in Christ Jesus, that they might bring up into bondage."
Liberty? what liberty? evidently that liberty
which consisted in exemption from the ceremonials
of the Mosaic law. Who then were these false brethren,
these sticklers for the ceremonial law? If the account
in the Acts is to be believed,&mdash;they were the
greater part of the fraternity of Christians in Jerusalem:
a party so considerable, that Peter, the chief
of the Apostles, though in his sentiments on this subject
so decidedly and completely opposite to them,
was obliged to give way to it: and, as to several of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
the obligations,&mdash;by which, as above stated, no small
obstacle was opposed to the progress of the religion
of Jesus,&mdash;the whole body of the Apostles found
themselves under the like necessity. If he himself is
to be believed, Gal. 2:12, the men in question were
men, who, if they continued in those scruples in
which they went beyond the brother of our Lord,
had, at any rate, in the first instance, received from
that highly distinguished personage their instructions.
And shortly after this, Acts 16:3, in deference
to this party, Paul himself "took Timothy, a Gentile,
and circumcised him." But, supposing the public
transactions, thus reported in the history of the author
of the Acts, to have really had place;&mdash;namely,
mission of Paul and Barnabas, from the Christians of
Antioch to Jerusalem,&mdash;mission of Judas Barsabas
and Silas, from the Apostles and elders, with Paul
and Barnabas in their company, to Antioch,&mdash;letter
of the Apostles and elders sent by them to the Christians
of Antioch,&mdash;all this supposed, how erroneous
soever in their opinions, in affirmance of the obligatoriness
of these ceremonials,&mdash;this majority, to
whose scruples the whole body of the Apostles saw
reason to give way,&mdash;could they, by this self-intruded
convert, be considered as persons to whom the epithet
of <i>false brethren</i>, would be admitted to be applicable?</p>

<p>6. Does it not seem, rather, that this story, about
the deputation of Paul and Barnabas to the Apostles
and brethren at Jerusalem from the Apostles at Antioch,
and the counter deputation of Judas Barsabas,
and Silas, to accompany Paul and Barnabas on their
return to Antioch, bearing all of them together a letter
from the Apostles at Jerusalem,&mdash;was an invention
of the anonymous author of the Acts? or else a
story, either altogether false, or false in great part,
picked up by him, and thus inserted?</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>7. Mark now, in this letter of Paul, another circumstance:
and judge whether it tends not to cast discredit
on what is said of Peter in the Acts.</p>

<p>In the Acts account we have seen Peter in the great
council, supporting, in a sort of speech, the liberty
side&mdash;of the question,&mdash;Jesus against Moses,&mdash;supporting
it in the great council, in which, in that same
account, Paul, though present, is, as to that point,
represented as silent: in that same account, shall we
see Peter, five years before this time, addressing
himself to the Gentiles,&mdash;using this same liberty,&mdash;and,
when called to account for doing so, employing
<i>his</i> pair of visions, his and Cornelius's, Acts 10:30-41,
in and for his defence: we shall see him in this new
part of his career,&mdash;in this part, for which he was by
both education and habits of life so ill qualified,&mdash;we
shall see him so much in earliest in this part of his
labors, as to have expended miracles,&mdash;a supernatural
cure, and even a raising from the dead,&mdash;for his
support in it.</p>

<p>Had any such facts really happened&mdash;facts in their
nature so notorious,&mdash;would Paul, in this letter of his
to the Galatians, have spoken of Peter, as if he had
never made, or attempted to make, any progress in
the conversion of the Gentiles? Speaking of the sticklers
for Moses, as well as of Peter,&mdash;would he have
said "When they saw that the Gospel of the uncircumcision
was committed unto me, as the Gospel of
the circumcision was to Peter?" Gal. 2:7, "For he
that wrought effectually in Peter to the Apostleship
of the circumcision, the same was mighty in
me toward the Gentiles?"</p>

<p>That, in some way or other, Peter had tried his
hand upon some persons who were Gentiles&mdash;in this
there is nothing but what may well enough be believed:
provided it be also believed&mdash;that, in the experiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
so made by him, he had little or no success:&mdash;for,
that after the expenditure of two such miracles
of so public a nature, besides a pair of visions,&mdash;he
had after all made so poor a hand of it, as to be content
to give up to Paul the whole of his prospects
from that quarter,&mdash;does it seem credible?</p>

<p>8. As to the partition-treaty itself,&mdash;whatsoever
were the incidents that had brought it about, nothing
could be more natural&mdash;nothing more probable&mdash;nothing
more beneficial to the common cause&mdash;to the
religion of Jesus, meaning always so far as the religion
taught by Paul was comfortable to it. Each retained
to himself the only part of the field, for the
cultivation of which he was qualified: each gave up
no other part of the field, than that, for the cultivation
of which he was <i>not</i> qualified.</p>

<p>9. Gal. 2:12. "For before that certain came from
James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they
were come, he withdrew, and separated himself,
fearing them which were of the circumcision.</p>

<p>10. "But contrariwise, when they saw that the
gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto
me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto
Peter.</p>

<p>11. "And when James, Cephas, and John, who
seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was
given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the
right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto
the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.</p>

<p>12. Gal. 2:10. "Only they would that we should
remember the poor; the same which I also was forward
to do.</p>

<p>13. "But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood
him to the face, because he was to be blamed.</p>

<p>14. "For before that certain came from James,
he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
come, he withdrew, and separated himself, fearing
them which were of the circumcision.&mdash;And the
other Jews dissembled likewise with him: insomuch
that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.</p>

<p>15. "But when I saw that they walked not uprightly
according to the truth of the gospel, I said
unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew,
livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do
the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live
as do the Jews?"</p>

<p>16. "Knowing that a man is not justified by
the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus
Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that
we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not
by the works of the law: for by the works of the
law shall no flesh be justified."</p>

<p>Note, in this same letter, the mention made of
Peter's eating with the Gentiles. "For before that
certain came from James, he, Peter, did eat with
the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew
and separated himself, fearing them which
were of the circumcision."</p>

<p>Note here, an additional reason for discrediting the
whole story of Peter's expedition,&mdash;<i>miracles</i> and
visions included,&mdash;as reported in the Acts. In regard to
the <i>visions</i>,&mdash;from this circumstance it may be seen,
that either no such visions were, as stated in the Acts
11:1-13, related by Peter, on his defence against the
accusations preferred against him on this ground,&mdash;or
that, if any such relation was given, no credit was
given to it: for, it is after this, and, according to
appearance, long after,&mdash;that, according to the Acts
15:1-33, not less than five years after, the meeting at
Jerusalem took place; that meeting, at which, at the
motion of James, the adherence to the Mosaic law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
was indeed in part dispensed with; but, so far as regards
the practice charged upon Peter as an offence,&mdash;namely
the eating with the Gentiles, insisted on and ordained.</p>

<p>If Paul's evidence was good and conclusive evidence
in support of Paul's visions,&mdash;how came
Peter's evidence not to be received as good and
conclusive evidence in support of Peter's visions?
Paul's evidence, with the visions reported by it, was
not better evidence, in support of his claim to the
Apostleship,&mdash;than Peter's visions, if the account in
the Acts is to be believed, in support of the abrogation
of the Mosaic law. Yet, as, according to the
author of the Acts, by Paul's account of his visions,
the Apostles were not any of them convinced; so
here, according to Paul, by Peter's account of his
visions, if ever really related to the fellowship of
the Apostles, and to the elders,&mdash;their associates,&mdash;that
same goodly fellowship was not convinced.</p>


<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 2.</h4>

<h5>PARTITION-TREATY&mdash;PROBABILITY GIVEN, BY THE FINANCIAL
STIPULATION, TO PAUL'S ACCOUNT OF IT.</h5>

<p>Of this important treaty, mention may have been
seen above. In the financial stipulation which may
have been observed in it,&mdash;may be seen a circumstance,
by which an additional degree of credibility
seems to be given, to Paul's account of the transaction;
at the same time that light is thrown upon the
nature of it. Paul alone, with his adherents, were to
address themselves to the Gentiles: but, in return for
the countenance given to him by Peter and the rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
of the Apostles, he was to <i>remember the poor</i>; which
is what, says he, "I also was forward to do." Now,
as to the remembering the poor, what is meant by it
at this time of day, was meant by it at that time of
day, or it would not have been meant by it at this:&mdash;supplying
money, need it be added? for the use
of the poor. Whatsoever, in relation to this money,
was the intention of the rulers,&mdash;whether to retain
any part in compensation for their own trouble, or
to distribute among the poor the whole of it, without
deduction;&mdash;in other words, whether profit as
well as patronage,&mdash;or patronage alone, and without
profit,&mdash;was to be the fruit;&mdash;human nature must,
in this instance, have ceased to be human nature, if,
to the men in question&mdash;Apostles as they were&mdash;the
money could have been altogether an object of indifference.
According to a statement, to which, as
above, ch. ii., though contained in this anonymous
history, there seems no reason to refuse credence,&mdash;community
of goods&mdash;a principle, even now, in these
days, acted upon by the Moravian Christians&mdash;was a
principle, acted upon in those days, by the Jewish
Christians. The property of each was thrown into
one common stock: and the disposal of it was committed
to a set of trustees, who&mdash;it is positively related&mdash;were
confirmed, and, to all appearance, were
recommended by,&mdash;and continued to act under the
influence of,&mdash;the Apostles.</p>

<p>On neither side were motives of the ordinary human
complexion&mdash;motives by which man's nature
was made to be governed&mdash;wanting, to the contracting
parties. By Peter and the rest of the Apostles,
much experience had been acquired, of the activity
and energy of this their self-constituted colleague:
within that field of action, which alone was suited
to their powers, and within which they had stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
exposed to be disturbed by his interference, within
that field to be secured against such interference,&mdash;was,
to them and their interests, an object of no small
moment. Such seems to have been the consideration,
on the part of the acknowledged and indisputable
Apostles.</p>

<p>Not less obvious was the advantage, which, by the
stipulation of this same treaty in his favour, was in
a still more effectual manner, secured to Paul. That,
when the whole transaction was so fresh,&mdash;all that
Paul was able to say for himself, with all that Barnabas
was able to say for him, had not been sufficient,
to induce the Apostles to give credence to his story
about the manner of his conversion,&mdash;in a word, to
regard him in any other light than that of an impostor,&mdash;is
directly asserted by the author of the
Acts. So again, in his unpremeditated speech to
the enraged multitude, Acts 22:18, "They will not
receive thy testimony concerning me," is the information
which the Acts make him report as having
been communicated to him by the Lord, when "while
I prayed in the Temple," says he, ver. 17, "I was
in a trance." Should a charge to any such effect
happen to encounter him in the course of his labours;&mdash;should
he, in a word, find himself stigmatized as an
impostor;&mdash;find himself encountered by a certificate
of impostorship;&mdash;a certificate, signed by the known
and sole confidential servants, as well as constant
companions, of that Jesus, whom&mdash;without so much
as pretending any knowledge of his person, he had
thus pretended to have heard without seeing him,&mdash;and
at a time and place, in which he was neither heard
nor seen by anybody else;&mdash;it is obvious enough, in
any such case, how formidable an obstruction of this
sort was liable to prove. On the other hand, so he
were but once seen to be publicly recognized, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
character of an associate and acknowledged labourer
in the same field,&mdash;a recognition of him in that character&mdash;a
virtual recognition at least, if not an express
one&mdash;would be seen to have taken place:&mdash;a recognition,
such as it would scarcely, at any time after, be
in their power to revoke: since it would scarcely be
possible for them, ever to accuse him of the principal
offence, without accusing themselves of the correspondent
connivance. Note, that, of this treaty, important
as it was&mdash;this partition-treaty&mdash;by which a
division was made of the whole Christian world&mdash;no
mention, not any the least hint, is to be found
in the Acts.</p>

<p>Thus much for this third visit of Paul's to Jerusalem,
reckoning from the time of his conversion:
thus much for this third visit, and the partition-treaty
that was the result of it. In and by his fourth
visit to that original metropolis of the Christian
world,&mdash;we shall see how this same treaty was violated&mdash;violated,
without any the slightest reason or
pretext, or so much as an attempt, on the part of
his anonymous biographer,&mdash;either by his own
mouth, or by that of his hero,&mdash;to assign a motive.
Violated&mdash;that is to say, by and on the part of Paul:
for, of Peter, no further mention is, in all this history,
to be found.</p>

<p>The truth is&mdash;that, instead of "the Acts of the
Apostles," the History of Paul&mdash;namely, from the
time of his conversion to the time of his arrival at
Rome&mdash;would have been the more proper denomination
of it. Of any other of the Apostles, and their
acts,&mdash;little, if anything, more is said, than what is
just sufficient, to prepare the reader, for the history
of Paul, by bringing to view the state of the Christian
world, at the time of his coming upon the stage.
As to Saint Peter,&mdash;the author's chief hero being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
all along Saint Paul, in whose train, during this last-mentioned
of his excursions, he represents himself
as being established,&mdash;what is said of Saint Peter and
his achievements, stands, as it were, but as an episode.
And though, by this historiographer, no mention
is made of the <i>partition-treaty</i>, it has eventually
been of use to us, by serving to show what, at the
time of entering into that engagement, was the situation
of St. Peter; and how good the title is, which
the transaction presents to our credence,&mdash;as being
so natural, because so manifestly for the advantage
of both the contracting parties, as well as of the
religion of Jesus, in so far as that of Paul was conformable
to it.</p>


<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 3.</h4>

<h5>TIME OF THE PARTITION TREATY, MOST PROBABLY
THAT OF VISIT I.</h5>

<p>The time, at which this partition-treaty took place,
appears involved in much obscurity, and presents
some difficulties: question&mdash;whether it was at the
first, or not till the third, of these visits&mdash;of these
four visits of Paul's to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The consideration, by which the assigning to it
the time of the first visit has been determined, is&mdash;that
it was at this first visit, that the demand for it,
in respect of all interests concerned, namely, that
of the religion of Jesus&mdash;that of the existing Christians
in general,&mdash;as well as that of the individuals
particularly concerned on both sides,&mdash;took place:
that, from that time, so, as far as appears, did the
observance of it: and that it was not till a long time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
after, that either symptoms, or complaints of non-observance,
seem to have made their appearance.</p>

<p>4. Among the conditions of the treaty, the financial
stipulation has been brought to view:&mdash;party to
be remembered, the poor&mdash;then under the gentle
sway of the Apostles: party, by whom they were to
be remembered, Paul&mdash;their recognized, though, for
aught appears, no otherwise than locally and negatively
recognized, associate. In and by the Deputation
Visit, on the part of Paul, with the assistance
of Barnabas,&mdash;we see this stipulation actually conformed
to and carried into effect. From the Christians
at Antioch to the Apostles at Jerusalem,&mdash;for
the benefit of the poor, at that metropolis of the
Christian world, by the conjoined hands of Paul and
Barnabas,&mdash;money, it has been seen, was actually
brought.</p>

<p>On the other hand, an observation which, at first
sight, may seem to shut the door against this supposition,
is&mdash;that whereas in his letter, to his Galatians,
Gal. i. 18, 19, after saying, "I went up to Jerusalem
to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days,"
and adding, "But other of the Apostles saw I none,
save James, the Lord's brother"; he, not more
than fourteen verses afterwards, Gal. 2:9, in the
verse in which his account of this important treaty
is continued,&mdash;speaks as if it was at that very time
that he had seen&mdash;not only the above two Apostles,
on this occasion designated by the names of James
and Cephas&mdash;but John likewise: and that this must
have been his third Jerusalem visit, because it is
after <i>mention</i> made of that same third visit, which,
in a passage intermediate between these, namely,
Gal. 2:1, is stated, in express terms, as being by
fourteen years posterior to his first visit,<a name="FNanchor_38_41" id="FNanchor_38_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_41" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> that
this circumstance, of his seeing John likewise, is
mentioned as having had place.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>
<p>But, in neither of these considerations, is there
anything, that presents itself as conclusive, against
the supposition&mdash;that whatever treaty there was,
took place at the first visit.</p>

<p>1. As to the first, at that time it is, that for giving
intimation of the treaty, <i>giving the right hands of
fellowship</i> is the expression employed: and that if
this union were to be taken in a literal, and thence
in a physical sense, as an agreement in which, as a
token of mutual consent, the physical operation of
junction of hands was employed,&mdash;here must have
been an actual meeting, in which John was seen as
well as the two others&mdash;and, consequently, on the
supposition that the account thus given by Paul, is,
in this particular, on both occasions correct,&mdash;this
must have been a different meeting from the first:
on which supposition, on comparison with the account
given in the Acts of Paul's second visit,&mdash;there
can be no difficulty in determining that this
visit cannot have been any other than the third. But,
so evidently figurative is the turn of the expression,&mdash;that,
even in the language used in this country at
this time, slight indeed, if it amounted to anything
at all, would be the force, of the inference drawn
from it, in favour of the supposition of mutual presence.
To signify an agreement on any point&mdash;especially
if regarded as important&mdash;who is there that
would scruple to speak of his having given the right
hand of fellowship to another, although it were
known to be only by letter? or, even through the
medium of a common friend, and without any personal
intercourse?</p>

<p>2. As to the other consideration, whatsoever might
be the force of it, if applied to a composition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
modern times&mdash;after so many intervening centuries,
during several of which the arts of literary composition
have, with the benefit of the facilities afforded
by the press, been the subject of general study and
practice;&mdash;whatsoever on this supposition might be
the force of it, applied to the style and character
of Paul, little weight seems necessary to be attached
to it. Of the confusion&mdash;designed or undesigned&mdash;in
which the style of this self-named Apostle involves
every point it touches upon, not a page can be read
without presenting samples in abundance, to every
eye that can endure to open itself to them: in this
very work, some must probably have already offered
themselves to notice; and before it closes, many will
be presented in this express view: the point in question
belongs to the field of chronology: and, of the
perturbate mode of his operation in this field, a particular
exemplification has been already brought to
view, Ch. 2, in a passage, in which, of a long train
of sufferings and perils,&mdash;some real, some to all appearance
not so&mdash;the one first undergone is last mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_39_42" id="FNanchor_39_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_42" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
From the order in which two events are
mentioned by this writer, no argument, in any degree
conclusive, can be deduced, for the persuasion, that
that which stands first mentioned, was so much as
intended by him to be regarded as that which first
took place.</p>

<p>In the very passage, in which the giving the right
hands of fellowship to him and Barnabas is mentioned,
and immediately after these very words,&mdash;it
is said&mdash;that "we <i>should go</i> unto the heathen, and
they unto the circumcision." Thus, then, the conjunct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
excursion of Paul and Barnabas&mdash;an excursion,
not commenced till about ten years after this
same first visit, Acts 13 and 14, is mentioned, as an
incident at <i>that</i> time future. True it is, that the
word directly expressive of the future is, in the
English translation, but an interpretation, and as
such marked. But, had any prior excursion of this
kind taken place before, there seems no reason to
suppose, that the event, which, by the context, would
surely have been taken for an event then as yet to
come,&mdash;would, had the intention been to represent
it as no more than a repetition of what had taken
place already, have received a form, so ill adapted to
its intended purpose.</p>

<p>But, two verses before, stands that, in which mention
is made of the circumstance, by which, according
to Paul, the course taken by the Apostles, in
respect of their entering, into this treaty, is brought
to view. "But contrariwise," says he, Gal. 2:7,
"when they saw that the Gospel of the uncircumcision
was committed unto me, as <i>the Gospel</i> of the
circumcision was unto Peter:" 9. "And when
James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars,
<i>perceived</i> the grace that was given to me, they
gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship;
that we <i>should go</i> unto the heathen," ...
&amp;c.</p>

<p>Now these <i>perceptions</i>&mdash;the perceptions thus
ascribed by him to the Apostles&mdash;when was it that
they were obtained? Evidently at no time whatever,
if not at the time of his <i>first</i> visit: for, these were
the perceptions&mdash;say rather the conceptions&mdash;the
conveyance of which is beyond dispute manifest, not
only from the whole nature of the case, according
to the accounts we have of it, but from the account
expressly given by the author of the Acts; and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
account, in some part confirmed, and not in any part
contradicted, by Paul himself, and in this very epistle.<a name="FNanchor_40_43" id="FNanchor_40_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_43" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>
<p>To conclude. That, at the time of the Deputation
Visit, Visit III., the treaty in question could not but
have been on the carpet, seems, it must be confessed,
altogether probable, not to say unquestionable. But,
that at the time of the Reconciliation Visit, Visit I.,&mdash;it
was already on the carpet, seems, if possible,
still more so. For, without some understanding between
Paul and the Apostles&mdash;and that to the effect
of this same treaty (the impossibility that Paul's
conversion story should have been the cause, having,
it is believed, been hereinabove demonstrated) without
some understanding of this sort, neither the continuance
ascribed to the Reconciliation Visit, nor the
existence of either of the two succeeding visits, to
wit, the Money-bringing Visit, and this Deputation
Visit, seem within the bounds of moral possibility.<a name="FNanchor_41_44" id="FNanchor_41_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_44" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

with a passage in his first Epistle to the Corinthians<a name="FNanchor_III._46" id="FNanchor_III._46"></a><a href="#Footnote_III._46" class="fnanchor">[III.]</a>&mdash;the
Bible edited by Scholey, in a note to Acts xv. 39, (being the passage
in which the rupture between Paul and Barnabas is mentioned),
draws the inference, that, after this rupture between Paul and
Barnabas, a reconciliation took place.
</p>
<p>
From the passage in question, if taken by itself, true it is that
this supposition is a natural one enough. For, according to all
appearances, the date of this Epistle to the Corinthians is posterior
to that of the rupture: and, from the conjunct mention of the two
names, if there were no evidence on the other side, it might naturally
enough be supposed probable, how far soever from certain, that
the intention was thereby, to report the two persons, as operating
in conjunction, and even in each other's company. But, to the
purpose of the argument no such supposition (it will be seen) is
necessary. Labouring they both were herein represented to be, and
to all appearance were, in the same field, viz. the field of the Gentiles:
labouring, after and in conformity to this same treaty&mdash;the
agreement made by them with the Apostles&mdash;the partition treaty so
often mentioned. But, from this it followed not, by any means, that
they were labouring in the <i>same part</i> of that field. For the purpose
of the argument, the question was&mdash;What was the sort of relation,
that had taken place, between these two preachers on the one part,
and their respective disciples on the other? It is of this relation
that it is stated by Paul, and stated truly, that as between him and
Barnabas, it was the same: both being actual labourers in their
respective parts of the same field: both being equally at liberty to
cease from, to put an end to, their respective labours at any time:
not that both were labouring in the same place, or in any sort of
concert. "Or I only, and Barnabas, have not we, says Paul, power
to forbear working?"
</p>
<p>
Thus inconclusive is the argument, by which the existence of a
reconciliation is inferred. Against evidence so weak, the contrary
evidence seems decisive. After mention made by him of the rupture,&mdash;had
any reconciliation ever taken place, within the compass of
time embraced by his history, would the author of the Acts have left
it unnoticed? That, among his objects was the painting every incident,
in colours at least as favourable, to the church in general, and
to Paul in particular, as he durst,&mdash;is sufficiently manifest. By a
rupture between two such holy persons,&mdash;a token, more or less impressive,
of human infirmity, could not but be presented to view:
and, to any reflecting mind&mdash;in those marks of <i>warmth</i> at least, to
say nothing worse, which, from first to last, are so conspicuous, in
the character and conduct, of this the historian's patron and principal
hero, ground could scarce fail to be seen, for supposing&mdash;that it
was to <i>his</i> side rather than that of Barnabas&mdash;the generous and ever-disinterested
Barnabas&mdash;that the blame, principally, if not exclusively,
appertained.</p></div>

<h4>SECTION 1.</h4>

<h5>PAUL'S ACCOUNT OF THIS INTERVIEW QUOTED.&mdash;ACTS
ACCOUNT OF WHAT FOLLOWED UPON IT.</h5>

<p>We now come to the last of the four different and
more or less distant occasions on which a personal
intercourse, in some way or other, is recorded as
having had place, between Paul on the one part, and
the Apostles or some of them on the other, antecedently
to that, on which Paul's history, so far as
any tolerably clear, distinct, and material, information
has descended to us, closes. Of this interview,
the scene lies at Antioch: Peter having, for some consideration
no otherwise to be looked for than by conjecture,
been led to pay a visit, to that place of
Paul's <i>then</i> habitual abode, after, and, as seems
probable, in consequence of, Paul's third recorded
visit to Jerusalem&mdash;his <i>Deputation Visit</i>.</p>

<p>Let us now cast an eye on the documents. Respecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
Paul's disagreement with Peter, the only
one we have, is that which has been furnished us by
Paul himself. It consists of the following passage
in his Epistle to his Galatians.</p>

<h5>GALATIANS 2:11 to 16.</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the
face, because he was to be blamed.&mdash;For before that certain came
from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come,
he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of
the circumcision.&mdash;And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him;
insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.&mdash;But
when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to
the truth of the Gospel, I said unto Peter before <i>them</i> all, If thou,
being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do
the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?&mdash;We
<i>who are</i> Jews by nature and not sinners of the Gentiles,&mdash;knowing
that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but
by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ,
that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the
works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be
justified.<br /><br /></p></div>

<p>Let us now see the account, given in the Acts, of
what passed in Antioch, in relation to Paul, Barnabas
and Silas,&mdash;during a period, which seems to be
either the same, or one in contiguity with it, probably
antecedent to it.</p>

<h5>ACTS 15:35 to 41.</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching
the word of the Lord with <i>many others</i> also.&mdash;And some days
after, Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our
brethren, in every city where we have preached the word of the
Lord, and see how they do.&mdash;And Barnabas determined to take
with them John whose surname was Mark.&mdash;But Paul thought not
good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia,
and went not with them to the work.&mdash;And the contention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from
the other: and so Barnabas took Mark and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'saled'">sailed</ins> unto Cyprus;&mdash;And
Paul chose Silas and departed, being recommended by the
brethren unto the grace of God.&mdash;And he went through Syria and
Cilicia, confirming the churches.<br /><br /></p></div>

<p>With regard to Paul's separation from Barnabas,
departure from Antioch, and taking Silas for a companion,&mdash;we
have nothing from Paul himself: nothing,
from any other source, than, as above, the
Acts.</p>

<p>In Paul's account, however, may be seen a passage,
Gal. 2:13, by which some light is thrown upon
the breach of Paul with Barnabas. In the Acts,
though the <i>"contention" is said to be "sharp,"</i> no
cause is stated for it, other than a difference respecting
the choice of a companion: namely, on an
excursion, which they are represented as having
agreed to make, in the company of each other, as
before.</p>

<p>But, according to Paul, he had had cause of complaint,
against his old friend Barnabas, on another
account. Barnabas had sided with the Apostles:
Barnabas had been "carried away with their dissimulation";
by the dissimulation of those Apostles
of Jesus, the virtuous simplicity of the self-constituted
Apostle, so he desires his Galatian disciples to
believe, had been foiled.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 2.</h4>

<h5>PAUL DISAGREES WITH PETER&mdash;AND BARNABAS&mdash;QUITS
ANTIOCH, TAKING SILAS FROM THE APOSTLES.</h5>

<p>In no place can this man exist, but to exercise hostility
or provoke it: with no man can he hold intercourse,
without acting towards him, if not in the
character of a despot, in that either of an open and
audacious, or in that of a secret adversary, or both.
Against Peter, at Jerusalem, in his Deputation Visit,
he is intriguing, while he is bargaining with him.
With the same Peter, when arrived at Antioch, he
quarrels: for, at Antioch, Peter was but a visitor&mdash;a
stranger; Paul, with Barnabas for his constant
supporter, was on his own ground: no betrayed
rulers <i>there</i> to fear&mdash;no persecuted Christians. He
quarrels&mdash;so he himself informs his Galatians&mdash;he
quarrels with the chief of the Apostles: he "withstands
him to his face." Why? because, forsooth,
"he was to be blamed." In conclusion, to such a
pitch,&mdash;by the degree of success, whatever it was,
which by this time he had experienced,&mdash;to such a
pitch of intemperance, had his mind swelled&mdash;he
quarrels even with Barnabas: with Barnabas&mdash;in all
his three antecedent visits to Jerusalem, his munificent
protector, and steady adherent: with that Barnabas,
in whose company, and under whose wing, one
of his missionary excursions had already been performed.
Acts 11:19-27; Ib. 2:37-40.</p>

<p>At Antioch, the number of his competitors could
not but be considerable: at Antioch, the number of
years, which he appears to have passed in that city,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
considered,&mdash;the number of his enemies could not be
small. He accordingly plans, and executes, a new
missionary excursion. He stands now upon his own
legs: no Barnabas now,&mdash;no necessary protector, to
share with him in his glory: to share with him, in
equal or superior proportion, in the profit of his profession:
in that profit, the image of which, in all its
shapes, was flitting before his eyes,&mdash;and which we
shall accordingly see him gathering in, in such unequalled
exuberance. He now looks out for a humble
companion&mdash;an assistant: he finds one in Silas: that
Silas, whom, with Judas Barsabas, we have seen
come to Antioch, deputed by the Apostles and their
disciples, to conclude, in that second metropolis, the
negotiation, commenced in the first metropolis of the
new Christian world. Deserter from the service
in which he was sent, Silas enlists in that of the
daring and indefatigable adventurer. Thus much,
and no more, do we learn concerning him: for, in
the picture drawn in the Acts, no character is given
to him, except the being found in company with
Paul, in some of the places which Paul visits: except
this exercise of the locomotive faculty, nothing
is there to distinguish him from the common stock
of still-life.</p>

<p>From this fourth recorded epoch in the intercourse
between Paul and the Apostles, we now pass to that
which stands fifth and last, to wit: that which was
produced by his fourth and last visit to Jerusalem:&mdash;his
<i>Invasion Visit</i>, A.D. 62.</p>

<p>In the interval, come four years,&mdash;occupied by a
series of successive excursions and sojournments,&mdash;in
the course of which, all mention of Silas is
dropped, without remark: dropped, in the same obscure
and inexplicit manner, in which the historian
affords to the reader, supposing him endowed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
the requisite degree of attention, the means of discovering,
Acts 16:10, that not long after the commencement
of this same period, the historian himself,
whoever he was, was taken into the train of the self-constituted
Apostle. To the reader is also left the
faculty, of amusing himself in conjecturing, about
what time, and in what manner, this latter event may
have taken place; an event, from which such important
consequences have resulted.</p>

<p>Of these portions of Paul's life, some view will
come to be taken, in a succeeding chapter, under
another head:&mdash;under the head of Paul's supposed
miracles: for, it is in the account given of his achievements
and adventures, and of the transactions in
which, in the course of this period, he was engaged,&mdash;it
is in the course of this account, that we shall have
to pick up, the supposed accounts of supposed miracles,
which, in this part of the Acts history lie interspersed.
This review must of necessity be taken, for
the purpose of placing in a true light, the evidence,
supposed to be thus afforded, in support of his claims
to a supernatural commission.</p>

<p>To this change of connection on the part of Silas,&mdash;from
the service of the Apostles of Jesus to that
of the self-constituted Apostle,&mdash;the character of
<i>defection</i> on the part of Silas,&mdash;<i>seduction</i> on the part
of Paul,&mdash;may here be ascribed without difficulty. By
the Apostles, one Gospel was preached&mdash;the Gospel
of Jesus:&mdash;we see it in the Evangelists. By Paul,
another and different Gospel was preached:&mdash;a Gospel,
later and better, according to him, than that
which is to be seen in the Evangelists:&mdash;a Gospel of
his own. If, even down to this time, mutual prudence
prevented an open and generally conspicuous rupture,&mdash;there
was on his part, at any rate, an opposition.
If, to men, whose conduct and temper were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
such as they uniformly appear to have been,&mdash;any
such word as <i>party</i> can, without disparagement, be
applied, here were two <i>parties</i>. He, who was <i>for</i>
the self-constituted Apostle, was <i>against</i> the Apostles
of Jesus. In a word, in the language of modern
party, Silas was a <i>rat</i>.</p>

<h5>THE PARTITION TREATY, AND THE PROCEEDINGS, IN RELATION
TO IT, DOWN TO THIS PERIOD, REVIEWED.</h5>

<p>In regard to the Partition Treaty,&mdash;taking the matter
from Paul's first, or Reconciliation Visit, A.D.
35, to his departure from Antioch, on his missionary
excursion, after the interview he had had at that
city with Peter,&mdash;the state of the affairs, between
Paul and the Apostles, seems to have been thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. On the occasion, and at the time, of his first
Jerusalem Visit&mdash;his Reconciliation Visit&mdash;a sort of
reconciliation&mdash;meaning at least an outward one&mdash;could
not,&mdash;consistently with the whole train, of what
is said of his subsequent intercourse and interviews
with the Apostles,&mdash;could not but have taken place.</p>

<p>2. Of this reconciliation, the terms were&mdash;that, on
condition of <i>his</i> preaching in the name of Jesus,&mdash;<i>they</i>
would not, to such persons in Jerusalem and
elsewhere, as were in connection with them,&mdash;<i>speak</i>
of him any longer in the character of a persecutor:
for, by his disobedience and breach of trust, as
towards the Jerusalem constituted authorities,&mdash;such
he had put it out of his power to <i>be</i> any longer: not
speak of him as a persecutor, but, on the contrary,
as an associate:&mdash;he taking up the name of Jesus:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
and preaching&mdash;never in his own, but on every occasion
in that holy, name.</p>

<p>3. On this occasion,&mdash;it being manifest to both
parties, that, by his intimate acquaintance with the
Greek language, and with the learning belonging to
that language, he was in a peculiar degree well qualified
to spread the name of Jesus among the Gentiles
in general;&mdash;that is, among those to whom the Jewish
was not a vernacular language;&mdash;whereas their acquaintance
with language was confined to their own,
to wit, the Jewish language;&mdash;on this occasion, it
followed of course, from the nature of the case, and
almost without need of stipulation, that,&mdash;leaving
to <i>them</i>, for the field of their labours, Jerusalem, and
that part of the circumjacent country, in which the
Jewish alone was the language of the bulk of the
population,&mdash;<i>he</i> should confine his exertions, principally
if not exclusively, to those countries, of which
Greek was, or at any rate Hebrew was not, the vernacular
language.</p>

<p>To him, at that time, it was not in the nature of
the case, that absentation from Jerusalem, or any
part of the country under the same dominion, should
be matter of regret. Within that circle, he could not,
for any length of time, abide publicly, for fear of the
legal vengeance of the constituted authorities: nor
yet among the Christians; although from their chiefs
he had obtained, as above, a sort of prudential endurance;
considering the horror, which his persecution
of them had inspired, and the terror, with which,
until his conversion had been proved in the eyes
of all by experience, he could not as yet fail to be
regarded.</p>

<p>Whatever was the object of his concupiscence,&mdash;whether
it were the fund&mdash;and we have seen how
attractive the bait was&mdash;which, at that time, in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
metropolis of the Christian world, offered itself to
an ambitious eye,&mdash;still, though his opportunities had
as yet confined his exertions to the <i>second</i> city in that
increasing world, his eyes never ceased looking to
the <i>first</i>.</p>

<p>Twice, accordingly, between the first of his Visits,&mdash;his
Reconciliation Visit&mdash;and this his last interview
with Peter,&mdash;we see him visiting that inviting
spot: each time, protected and escorted by the munificent
Barnabas and his influence&mdash;to make him endurable:
each time with a public commission&mdash;to make
him respected:&mdash;- the first time with money in his
hand&mdash;to make him welcome.</p>

<p>That, all this while, neither <i>good faith</i> nor <i>prudence</i>
were capable of opposing to the violence of his
ambition, any effectual check,&mdash;- is abundantly manifest.</p>

<p>That <i>good faith</i> was not, we learn distinctly from
himself. For though, from the very nature of the
two correlative situations, it is out of all question, as
above, that, without some agreement to the effect
above mentioned, he could not, even with the benefit
of every possible means of concealment, have been
preserved for two days together from the vengeance
which pressed upon him, from <i>below</i> as well as from
<i>above</i>; yet still was he, by his secret intrigues, Gal.
1:11, violating the treaty, at the expense of those
upright, patient, and long-suffering men, to whose
observance of it, he was every day indebted for his
life.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<h4>SECTION 4.</h4>

<h5>PETER AND THE APOSTLES JUSTIFIED AS TO THE FINANCIAL
STIPULATION IN THE TREATY,<br /> AND THE SUCCEEDING
MISSIONARY LABOURS OF PETER AMONG THE GENTILES.</h5>

<p>Of the financial stipulation, the account we have has
been seen:&mdash;an account given by one of the parties
to it&mdash;Paul:&mdash;the other party being&mdash;the Apostles.
In the instance of Paul, in the demonstration, supposed
to be given of it, the worldliness, of the motives
which gave birth to it, has in a manner been taken
for granted. Well, then, if in the one instance such
was the character of it,&mdash;in the other instance, can it
have been any other? The question is a natural one;
but not less so is the answer. For note, the stipulation
is express&mdash;that, by Paul&mdash;by Paul out of the
profits of his vocation&mdash;the poor, meaning the poor
of Jerusalem&mdash;the poor among the disciples of the
Apostles&mdash;should be remembered. Remembered, and
how? Remembered, by payment of the money&mdash;into
the hands, either of the Apostles themselves, or,
what comes to the same thing, some other persons,
in connection with them, and acting under their influence.
Now, then, once more. Of the man, by whom
the money was to be <i>paid</i>&mdash;of this man, the motives,
you say, were worldly: is it credible then, that they
should have been less so, in the instance of the men
by whom they were to be <i>received</i>?</p>

<p>Answer. Oh! yes, <i>that</i> it is. Between the two
cases, there is this broad difference. Whatever Paul
might receive, he would receive for himself: whatever,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
after payment made, under the treaty, to the
use of the Jerusalem poor, he retained,&mdash;he might
retain for his own use. But the Apostles&mdash;that
which, if anything, they received, in the name of the
poor, and as for the use of that same poor,&mdash;would
they&mdash;could they, for their own use, retain it, or any
part of it? Not they, indeed. Not in their hands
were the poor's funds: not in theirs, but in a very
different set of hands:&mdash;in the hands of a set of
trustees&mdash;of the trustees already mentioned in this
work, Ch. 2&mdash;of those administrators, whose function,
to every reader who has not the Greek original
in view, is so unfortunately disguised by the word
<i>Deacons</i>. And these deacons, by whom appointed?
By the Apostles? No; but, by the whole communion
of the saints&mdash;by the whole number of the members
of the Christian commonwealth;&mdash;and in the way of
free election,&mdash;<i>election, on the principle of universal
suffrage</i>. Monarchists and Aristocrats! mark well!&mdash;<i>of
universal suffrage</i>.</p>

<p>So much for the treaty itself. Now, as to the subsequent
conduct of the parties, under it, and in relation
to it. As to the partition&mdash;Paul to the Gentiles,
Peter and his associates to the Jews&mdash;such was the
letter of it. Such being the letter&mdash;what, at the same
time, was the spirit of it? Manifestly this: on the
one hand, that the field, to which Paul's exertions
should apply themselves, and confine themselves,
should be that field, for the cultivation of which, with
any prospect of success, he was exclusively qualified:
on the other hand, that the field, to which their exertions
should apply themselves and confine themselves,
should be that, for the cultivation of which,
they were&mdash;if not exclusively, at any rate more peculiarly,
qualified. In a word&mdash;that, of all that portion
of the world, that presented itself as open to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
exertions, of those who preached in the name of
Jesus,&mdash;they should reserve to themselves that part
which was already in their possession, to wit, Jerusalem,
and its near neighbourhood, together with
such parts of Judea, and its neighbourhood, of which
their own language, the Hebrew, was the vernacular
language: this minute portion of the world reserved,
all the rest was to be left open to him: over every
other part of it he was to be at liberty to cast forth
his shoe. Judea&mdash;the country of the Jews? say,
rather, the Jews themselves:&mdash;the Jews wherever
found: for, revelation apart, it was in <i>language</i>, that
Paul's pretensions&mdash;his exclusive qualifications&mdash;consisted.
The Apostles spoke nothing but Hebrew:
Paul was learned, and eloquent, in a certain sort,
in Greek.</p>

<p>In regard to the interpretation to be put upon this
treaty,&mdash;suppose any doubt to have place,&mdash;in the
word <i>Gentile</i>, would obviously the seat and source
of it to be to be found. Suppose, on the one hand
<i>persons</i> to be the objects, of which it was meant to
be designative,&mdash;then, let there be but so much as one
single uncircumcised man in Jerusalem, or elsewhere,&mdash;to
whom, in the view of gaining him over to their
communion, the Apostles, or, with their cognizance,
any of their disciples, addressed themselves,&mdash;here
would, on <i>their</i> part, be a breach of the treaty. Suppose,
on the other hand, <i>places</i> to be the objects, of
which it was meant to be designative,&mdash;on that supposition,
within that tract of country, within which
alone, the necessary means, of communicating with
the bulk of the population, were in their possession,&mdash;they
might apply themselves, to all persons without
restriction: and this, still without any real breach of
the agreement&mdash;of the spirit and real import of the
agreement.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>In respect either of <i>persons or places</i>, by the agreement,
according to this&mdash;the obvious sense of it&mdash;what
was it that Paul gave up? In truth, just nothing.
Had <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'has'">his</ins> mind been in a sober state,&mdash;strange indeed,
if the field thus afforded by the whole heathen world,
was not wide enough for his labour: in all parts of it
he could not be at once; and the most promising parts
were open to his choice. Cessation of Paul's hostilities
excepted, what was it that the Apostles gained?
Not much more.</p>

<p>As already observed&mdash;what was not gained by it,
is what is above: what was really gained by it, is
what follows.</p>

<p>What Paul gained was&mdash;exemption from the annoyance,
which otherwise he would everywhere have
been exposed to have received, by being designated
as the quondam notorious persecutor, and still unreconciled
enemy, of the Apostles and their disciples:&mdash;in
a word, of all others who preached in the name
of Jesus.</p>

<p>That which the Apostles actually gained, was&mdash;that
confirmation and extension of their influence,
which followed of course, upon every extension, received
by that field, within which the influence of the
name of Jesus was extended.</p>

<p>That which, besides what is above, they <i>ought to</i>
have gained, but did not gain, is&mdash;exemption from
all such annoyance, as could not but be inflicted on
them, in proportion as Paul, preaching to persons, to
whom <i>they</i> had access, a Gospel which was his, and
not theirs,&mdash;should, while in pretence and name an
associate, be, in truth and effect, an adversary and
opponent.</p>

<p>This is what&mdash;though they not only should have
gained, but might also reasonably have expected to
gain&mdash;they did <i>not</i> gain. For, not to insist any more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
on his secret intrigues in Jerusalem itself, and his
open opposition in the second Jerusalem, Antioch,
as above; we shall&mdash;when we come to the next and
last of his interviews with the Apostles on the occasion
of his Invasion Visit&mdash;see, to what lengths the
madness of his ambition carried him, in that birthplace
and metropolis of the Christian world.</p>

<p>By the sort of connection, which, notwithstanding
such obvious and naturally powerful principles of
discrimination, have on each occasion, been visible, as
between the undoubted Apostles, and this self-styled
one&mdash;three distinguishable questions cannot but, from
time to time, have been presenting themselves:&mdash;1.
The sort of countenance&mdash;partial, cold, and
guarded as it was&mdash;shown by the old established and
goodly fellowship to the ever-intruding individual&mdash;is
it credible? 2. Can it, in fact, have been manifested,
in conjunction with a disbelief, on their part,
of his pretensions to a degree of supernatural favour
with the Almighty, equal or superior to their own?
3. And, if not only possible, but actual&mdash;was it, in
point of morality, justifiable?</p>

<p>By a few obvious enough considerations, an answer&mdash;and,
it is hoped, a not altogether <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'unsatifactory'">unsatisfactory</ins>
one,&mdash;may be given to all these questions.</p>

<p>As to whatever was natural in the course of the
events, Barnabas was necessary to the rising Church:
and Paul was, all along, necessary, or, at least, was
so thought, to Barnabas.</p>

<p>1. Barnabas was necessary to the Church. Already,
it has been seen, how preeminent was the support
received by it from his munificence. In him, it had
found at once the most liberal of benefactors, and,
unless Peter be an exception, the most indefatigable
of agents. On the part of no one of even the chosen
servants of Jesus, do proofs of equal zeal and activity
present themselves to our view.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>In an ensuing chapter, we shall see Peter trying
his strength among the Gentiles. Yet, from the direction
thus given to his Apostolic zeal, no violation of
the treaty, it will be seen, can with justice be imputed
to him, if the interpretation above given to the word
<i>Gentiles</i> be correct.</p>

<p>1. In the first place,&mdash;according to the Acts, the
date of this excursion is <i>antecedent</i> to that third interview,
which took place on the occasion of Paul's third
Jerusalem Visit&mdash;his Deputation Visit: that is to say,
to the time, at which, and not before, though, if the
above reasoning be just, in a sort of general terms
the preliminaries had been agreed upon, the general
preliminary arrangements were followed, confirmed,
explained, and liquidated, by more particular ones.</p>

<p>2. In the next place&mdash;of all the places,&mdash;which, in
the course of this excursion of Peter's, are mentioned
as having been visited by him,&mdash;there is not one, that
Paul is mentioned as having ever visited: whereas, in
the first of them that is mentioned, the Apostles are
mentioned as having already a band of disciples.<a name="FNanchor_42_47" id="FNanchor_42_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_47" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>3. In the third place,&mdash;the date, assigned to this
excursion of Peter's, is, by several years, antecedent
even to the first, of the several excursions of Paul's,
of which mention is made in the Acts. In the received
chronology&mdash;date assigned to the commencement of
Peter's excursion, A.D. 35; date assigned to Paul's
first excursion, A.D. 45.</p>

<p>While Peter was thus occupying himself, Paul was
still at Tarsus:<a name="FNanchor_43_48" id="FNanchor_43_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_48" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> at Tarsus&mdash;his own birthplace&mdash;whereto,&mdash;in
consequence of the danger, to which his
life had been exposed by his first Jerusalem Visit, his
Reconciliation Visit,&mdash;he had taken his flight.<a name="FNanchor_44_49" id="FNanchor_44_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_49" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p><p>4. In the fourth place,&mdash;notwithstanding the perpetual
hostility of Paul's mind, as towards Peter and
the rest of the Apostles,&mdash;on no occasion, on the score
of any breach of this article in the partition treaty, is
any complaint, on the part of Paul, to be found. When
dissatisfaction is expressed, doctrine alone is mentioned
by him as the source of it: doctrine, the ostensible;
dominion, the original and real source.</p>

<p>Spite of the treaty,&mdash;spite of the manifest interest,
of the only genuine religion of Jesus&mdash;the Gospel
taught by the Apostles,&mdash;still in places to which they
had access&mdash;in places in which, in consequence, they
had formed connections,&mdash;he persisted in intruding
himself: intruding himself, with that Gospel which
he says himself, was his, not theirs&mdash;and not being
theirs, was not Jesus's:&mdash;intruding himself, in places,
in which, even had his Gospel been Jesus's, <i>their</i> connections
being established, there existed no demand
for him and <i>his</i>. Can this be doubted of? If yes, all
doubt will at any rate be removed, when,&mdash;spite of
all the endeavours that could be employed, either by
them or by his own adherents, to prevail upon him to
desist,&mdash;we shall see him entering Jerusalem on his
Invasion Visit: as if, while, for preaching the religion
of Jesus, all the world, with the exception of the
Jewish part of it, was not enough for this intruder,&mdash;the
Apostles of Jesus&mdash;eleven in number, with their
elected associate, Matthias,&mdash;were not, all together,
enough, for that small part of it.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>name</i> he preached in, <i>that</i> indeed not his own,
but Jesus's: but the <i>doctrine</i> he preached&mdash;the Gospel,
as he called it&mdash;not <i>Jesus's</i>, nor anybody else's,
but his own. All this, as he has the assurance to declare,&mdash;all
this did he preach without their knowledge.
And why without their knowledge? because,
as he himself has the still more extraordinary assurance
to <i>declare</i>&mdash;for <i>confession</i> is the result not of
assurance, but weakness&mdash;because, as he himself
acknowledges,&mdash;if so it had been, that this Gospel of
his had come to the knowledge of the Apostles&mdash;of
those associates, to whom he was all along holding
out the right hand of fellowship, this Gospel of his
could not have been listened to&mdash;this preaching of his
would have been in vain.</p>

<p>Already, however&mdash;for in this he may be believed&mdash;already,
throughout this <i>first</i> intercourse, though
the expression is not used till he came to speak of the
<i>third</i>,&mdash;already must the right hand of fellowship
have been held out, and on both sides: and, what
followed of course,&mdash;and was not only affirmed by his
statement, but demonstrated by the result,&mdash;on this
last occasion was the treaty again brought upon the
carpet and confirmed, after such modifications as it
may naturally have received, from the consideration
of intervening incidents.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3><i>Paul disbelieved continued&mdash;The Fourth and Last
Jerusalem Visit. The Purpose concealed:<br /> Opposition
universal; among his own Disciples, and
among those of the Apostles.</i></h3>


<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 1.</h4>

<h5>MOTIVES TO THIS VISIT.</h5>

<p>Of this momentous visit to say what were the real
objects, must in a great part be left to conjecture:&mdash;to
inferences drawn from the known circumstances
of the case. By himself, as will be seen, they were
concealed with the most persevering anxiety.</p>

<p>But, in default of direct evidence, the point may
without much danger of error be settled by circumstantial
evidence. The common objects of political
concupiscence&mdash;money, power and vengeance&mdash;were
all before his eyes: <i>money</i>&mdash;in no less a quantity than
that of the aggregate mass of the property of the
whole church:&mdash;that fund, for the management of
which, the Apostles' seven trustees, under the name
of Deacons, were not more than sufficient:&mdash;that
fund, by which the repulsed concupiscence of the sorcerer
of Samaria had so lately been excited:&mdash;<i>power</i>,
that which was exercised by the direction of the consciences
of the whole number of the faithful, some
time before this, not less in number than three thousand:
<i>vengeance</i>, for the repeated rebuffs, by which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
at the interval of so many years from each other, his
endeavours to supplant the Apostles had been repelled.</p>

<p>In a general point of view, ambition,&mdash;rival ambition,&mdash;the
same motive which sent Caesar to Rome,
may be stated as having sent Paul, at this time, to
Jerusalem: to Jerusalem&mdash;the metropolis of the
Christian world, by design; and thence, eventually
and undesignedly, to the metropolis of the whole
civilized world.</p>

<p>By two opposite desires&mdash;two antagonizing but correspondent
and mutually explanatory desires&mdash;desires,
in both parts intense and active, the external
marks of which are sufficiently visible in two different
quarters,&mdash;the nature as well as prevalence of this
motive, will, it is believed, be found sufficiently
proved:&mdash;a desire, in the breast of the self-constituted
Apostle, to establish himself in the original
metropolis of the Christian world:&mdash;a desire on the
part of the Apostles&mdash;of the Apostles constituted by
Jesus&mdash;to keep him out of it.</p>

<h4>SECTION 2.</h4>

<h5>THE VISIT ANNOUNCED BY PAUL AND DEFERRED.</h5>

<p>Ephesus, at which place he had arrived not long after
his departure from Corinth, where he had made a
stay, as it should seem, of more years than one,<a name="FNanchor_45_50" id="FNanchor_45_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_50" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
touching in the way at Cenchrea, where he shaved his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
head for the performance of a vow&mdash;Ephesus is the
place, at which, by the author of the Acts, Paul is for
the first time made to speak of himself, as harbouring,
having in mind the making of this visit: and on
that occasion, the visit is spoken of, as being the subject
of a settled determination, and in particular as
being the time fixed upon by him for the execution of
this design. Acts 18:20, 21. "When they, the Jews
at Ephesus, desired him to tarry longer with them,
he consented not; but bade them farewell, saying,
I must <i>by all means keep this feast</i> that cometh in
Jerusalem: but I will return again to you if God
will."</p>

<p>As to the keeping of this or any other feast at Jerusalem
or at any other place&mdash;if it was under any such
notion as that of contributing to his own personal salvation
by any such Mosaic work, it was an object inconsistent
with his own principles&mdash;with his own so
repeatedly and strenuously advocated principles:&mdash;and
the like may be said of the head-shaving and the
vow, performed by him, at Cenchrea, in his way to
Ephesus from Corinth: and moreover, in this last-mentioned
instance, more particularly in contradiction
with a precept so positively delivered by Jesus,
namely, <i>Swear not at all</i>,&mdash;if, under swearing, the
making of vows is to be understood to be included.</p>

<p>Of this design, the next intimation which occurs
in the Acts, is in the next chapter, Acts 19:21, "When
these things were ended," namely, the discomfiture
of the exorcists, and the burning of the books of curious
arts at Ephesus,&mdash;"Paul, it is said, <i>purposes
in the spirit</i>, when he had passed through Macedonia
and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After
I have been there, I must also see Rome."</p>

<p>Fortunate it is for the credit&mdash;either <i>of the spirit</i>,
or of Paul, or of the author of the Acts, that it was on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
this second occasion only, and not on the first, that
it was <i>in the spirit</i> that he proposed to go to Jerusalem
by the then next feast: for, notwithstanding the
"<i>must</i>" and the "<i>by all means</i>,"&mdash;so it is, that between
those his two determinations as above, no less
a space of time than two years is stated as elapsing,
on one occasion, at one and the same place.<a name="FNanchor_46_51" id="FNanchor_46_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_51" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> And
this place&mdash;what was it? it was Ephesus: the same
place, at which, on his departure from it, the first
determination was declared: after which, and before
this his second visit to Ephesus,&mdash;he is represented
as having visited Csarea and Antioch.</p>

<p>The next mention, is that which occurs in the next
chapter, chapter 20:16. "Paul," we are there told,
being then at Miletus, "had determined to sail by
Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in
Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to
be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost."</p>

<p>At Miletus it is, that he sends for, and receives,
from Ephesus, a number of his adherents in that
place. Upon their arrival, he is represented as making
a formal speech to them: and now, he not merely
proposes in the spirit, as before, but is "<i>bound in the
spirit</i>," to go thither.<a name="FNanchor_47_52" id="FNanchor_47_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_52" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Vain would be the attempt
to ascertain, with any approach to exactness, the interval
of time, during which the operation of the
spirit remained in a sort of suspense between <i>purpose</i>
and <i>obligation</i>: it may have been months, only:
it may have been years.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>
<p>While, by one spirit, Paul was thus urged on, every
now and then, towards Jerusalem;&mdash;by the same
spirit, or by another spirit, he was pulled back.<a name="FNanchor_48_53" id="FNanchor_48_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_53" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>In the very next verse, Acts 20:22, in which he
speaks of his being "bound in the spirit unto" that
place, not knowing, as, in his speech, he thereupon
adds,&mdash;"not knowing the things that shall befall
me there,"&mdash;he goes on, and says: "Save that the
Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying, that
bonds and afflictions abide me. But none of these
things," says he, ver. 24, "move me, neither count
I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my
course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received
of the Lord Jesus, to testify the Gospel of
the grace of God."</p>

<p>To raise, in the breast of Paul, the expectation,
that of his proceeding in the course it was his way to
take in preaching that religion, to which, from a persecutor,
he had, in appearance, become a convert,
affliction, in a variety of shapes, might prove to be
the fruits,&mdash;needed no information from the spirit;
if, by receiving information from the spirit, he meant
any communication of a supernatural kind&mdash;anything
beyond information in the ordinary shape;&mdash;be
the effect&mdash;be the purpose, good or bad,&mdash;such is the
lot, that awaits innovation in the field of politics&mdash;the
spiritual part included, as well as the temporal&mdash;at
all places, and all times.</p>

<p>A passage, which now presents itself, helps to show
how easily and copiously, out of a few words, written
in ancient times, mysteries and miracles have been
manufactured in modern times. In Acts 20:22, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
have seen Paul, "<i>bound in the spirit</i>," as he is made
to assure us, to go unto Jerusalem. In the next chapter,
21:4, we find disciples ... who said to Paul,
"<i>through the spirit</i>," that he should <i>not</i> go up to
Jerusalem. Oh! what a useful word this word
<i>spirit</i>! Let a man say plainly and simply, I shall go,
or be going, to Jerusalem&mdash;or, Don't go to Jerusalem,&mdash;his
words go for no more than they are worth:
in either case, with a proper proposition to introduce
it, add the word "spirit," the matter becomes serious.
Out of a word or two, you thus add to the Godhead a
third person, who talks backward and forward for
you, and does for you whatever you please.</p>

<p>At so small a price, even to this day, are manufactured,
every day, a sort of <i>verbal</i> miracles, which, as
many as are disposed, are welcome to improve into
real ones.</p>

<p>To reconcile men to this expedition of Paul's, the
spirit was the more necessary,&mdash;inasmuch as it was
not in his own power, or even in that of any one of his
numerous attendants and dependants, to assign so
much as one ostensible reason for it.</p>

<p>That, to the advancement of religion&mdash;of the religion
of Jesus&mdash;no such presence of his was necessary;&mdash;that
no good could result from it;&mdash;that much
evil could not but result from it;&mdash;was obvious to all
eyes. Of the original number of the Apostles,&mdash;for
aught that appears, not less than eleven were still remaining
on the spot: men, to every one of whom, all
acts and sayings of Jesus were, by memory, rendered
so familiar:&mdash;men, on the part of some of whom, and,
at any rate, on the part of the chief of them, Peter,&mdash;there
was no want of zeal and activity. While to
these men a single city, or, at the utmost, one small
region&mdash;composed the whole field of exertion&mdash;the
whole earth besides is left open by them to Paul: still,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
such is the ravenousness of his ambition, nothing can
content him, but he must be intruding himself&mdash;thrusting
his restless sickle into their ripening harvest.</p>

<h4>SECTION 3.</h4>

<h5>THE DESIGN INDEFENSIBLE.</h5>

<p>All this&mdash;is it not enough? Well then, take this
one other&mdash;this concluding proof. In the teeth of all
their endeavours, and among them, some that will
be seen extraordinary enough, to prevent it,&mdash;was
undertaken the fourth and last of his four recorded
visits to their residence&mdash;Jerusalem.</p>

<p>But, in the first place, in the utter indefensibility
of the design, shall be shown the <i>cause</i>, of the opposition
so universally made to it.</p>

<p>Tired of a mixture of successes and miscarriages,&mdash;disdaining
the conquests he had been making in so
many remote, and comparatively obscure regions of
the world,&mdash;he had formed&mdash;but at what precise time,
the documents do not enable us to pronounce&mdash;the
determination, to exhibit his glories on the two most
illustrious of theatres:&mdash;in the two capitals&mdash;Jerusalem,
of the Jewish, and now of the Christian world;
Rome, of the whole classical heathen world:&mdash;and
in the first place, Jerusalem, now, for the fourth time
since his conversion. It was at Ephesus, as we have
seen, this determination was first declared.</p>

<p>To Rome, he might have gone, and welcome:
namely, in so far as his doctrines could have confined
themselves within the limits of those of Jesus:
which, however, it will be seen, they could not: but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
success being moreover supposed, nothing but good
could such visit have had for its result.</p>

<p>But, by a visit to any place other than Jerusalem,
various were the points of spleen and ambition, that
could not have been satisfied. Nothing would serve
him, but, over that Edom Jerusalem, he would, in
the first place, cast forth his shoe.</p>

<p>Unless the eleven most confidential servants,
selected by Jesus himself to be the propagators of
his religion, were altogether unworthy of the task
thus allotted to them,&mdash;nothing to the good purposes
of that religion could be more palpably unnecessary,
nothing to the purposes of peace and unity more pernicious,
than the intrusion thus resolved upon. That
the number of these legitimately instituted Apostles
had as yet suffered any diminution, is not, by any of
the documents, rendered so much as <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'probably'">probable</ins>.
Neither in the works of Paul himself, nor in that of
his historiographer, is any intimation to any such
effect to be found. In their own judgments, had there
been any need of coadjutors&mdash;any deficiency of hands
for the spiritual harvest,&mdash;they well knew how to supply
it. Of the sufficiency of such knowledge, they had
given the most incontestable proofs: the election of
Matthias was the fruit of it. They showed&mdash;and
with a disinterestedness, which has never since had,
nor seems destined to have, any imitators&mdash;that, in
the Christian world, if government in any shape has
divine right for its support, it is in the shape of democracy;&mdash;representative
democracy&mdash;operating by
universal suffrage. In the eye of the Christian, as
well as of the philosopher and the philanthropist, behold
here the only <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'ligitimate'">legitimate</ins> government: the form,
the exclusion of which from the Christian world, has
been the object of that league, by which, by an unpunishable,
yet the most mischievous&mdash;if not the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
mischievous&mdash;sort of blasphemy, the name of Christian
has been profaned.</p>

<p>This method of filling offices, was no more to the
taste of Paul, than to that of a Napoleon or a George.
He determined to open their eyes, and prove to them
by experience, that monarchy,&mdash;himself the first
monarch&mdash;was the only legitimate form of government.
The difficulties of the enterprise were such as
could not escape any eyes:&mdash;least of all his own: but
to die or conquer was his resolve: so he himself declares.<a name="FNanchor_49_54" id="FNanchor_49_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_54" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
What, in case of success, would have been
the use made by him of it? The fate of the Apostles
may be read in the catastrophe of Saint Stephen: the
vulgar herd would, in his eyes, have been as declaredly
foolish as the Galatians. Gal. 3:1. "O, foolish
Galatians!" Who did bewitch you, etc.</p>

<p>The invasion was not less inconsistent with good
faith, than with brotherly love, peace and unity. It
was a direct violation of the <i>partition-treaty</i>: that
treaty, of which he gives such unquestionable evidence
against himself, in the boast he makes of it to
his Galatians. Gal. 2:9. "When James, Cephas
(Peter), and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived
the grace that was given unto me, they gave
to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship,
that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto
the circumcision."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 4.</h4>

<h5>OPPOSITION MADE TO IT BY HIS OWN ATTENDANTS AND
OTHER ADHERENTS.</h5>

<p>To find so much as the colour of a reason for this
perfidy, was too much for the ingenuity of his <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'attedant'">attendant</ins>
panegyrist. In the eyes of the whole body of
his attendants, of whom the historian was one, so
completely unjustifiable was his design in every point
of view,&mdash;they joined in a remonstrance to him, beseeching
him to give it up.</p>


<h5>ACTS 21:12 to 14.</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place,
besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.&mdash;Then Paul answered,
What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart? for I am ready
not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem, for the name of
the Lord Jesus.&mdash;And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased,
saying, The will of the Lord be done.<br /><br /></p></div>

<p>At no such loss, however, was Paul himself: for
this, and for everything else it was his will to do, he
had a reason ready made. It was no less concise and
economical than convenient: a word, and no more
than a word, was the price paid for it:&mdash;<i>revelation</i>
was that word.<a name="FNanchor_50_55" id="FNanchor_50_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_55" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> So he assures his "foolish" Galatians:
and if they were foolish enough to believe it,
these, though first, have not been last, in the career
of foolishness.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>
<p>Allow a man but the use of this one word, so it be
in the sense in which Paul here uses it&mdash;admit the
matter of fact, of which it contains the assertion,&mdash;the
will of that man is not only sufficient reason, but
sufficient law, for everything: in all places, and to all
persons, his will is law. The will of this man is the
will of that God, by whom this revelation of it has
been made to him: the will of God, what man shall
be audacious enough to dispute?</p>

<p>The motives, which gave birth to this act of perfidy
and hostility, will now be visible enough, to
every eye, that dares to open itself to them. At the
time in question, they were too manifest to need mentioning:
and at the same time too unjustifiable, to
bear to be mentioned by his dependent historian, when
speaking of the opposition, which, even on the part of
his own dependents, it produced. They besought him&mdash;with
tears they besought him: but, as to the reflections
by which these tears were produced, they could
not bear the light: it was not for a declared adherent
to give them utterance. The sort of colour, put upon
the project by Paul, with the help of one of his phrases&mdash;this
was the only colour that could be found for it. It
was for the <i>name</i> of the Lord Jesus, Acts 21:13, that
he was ready&mdash;"ready, not to be bound only, but also
to die." For the name? O, yes, for the name at all
times; for, in the name of Jesus, he beheld from first
to last his necessary support: and of the Lord Jesus,
nothing, as we shall find,&mdash;nothing from first to last,
did he ever employ but the name. But, to be bound at
Jerusalem&mdash;to die at Jerusalem&mdash;to be bound&mdash;to die&mdash;supposing
this to take place,&mdash;where&mdash;to the religion
of Jesus&mdash;would be, where could be, the use of
it? There, at Jerusalem, the Apostles&mdash;the real
Apostles of Jesus:&mdash;executing, without either dying
or being bound for it, the commission, which to them
had been really given by Jesus.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 5.</h4>

<h5>OPPOSITION MADE TO IT BY THE APOSTLES AND THEIR
DISCIPLES.</h5>

<p>Thus indefensible and deplorable, in the eyes even of
his own dependents,&mdash;it may be imagined in what
light the invasion presented itself at Jerusalem, to
those who found themselves so cruelly menaced by it.</p>

<p>At the first place, at which, after a voyage of some
length, they landed on their way to Judea,&mdash;they
found the alarm already spread. This place was
Tyre: there they found "disciples," Acts 21:4, "who
said to Paul," and "through the Spirit, that he
should not go up to Jerusalem." It was through
<i>their spirit</i>, that they bade him not to go; but <i>his
revelation</i>, as we have seen, bade him to go, notwithstanding:&mdash;his
revelation was too strong for their
spirit. If it was from the <i>Lord Jesus</i>, as he all along
informs us, that his revelation came, while their
spirit was the <i>Holy Spirit</i>, otherwise called the <i>Holy
Ghost</i>,&mdash;already another schism was produced: a
schism, in a council still higher than that of the Apostles.</p>

<p>At Ptolemais, on the road from Tyre to Jerusalem,
they stayed but one day: Acts 21:7, not long enough,
it should seem, for any fresh marks of opposition to
this enterprise to manifest themselves.</p>

<p>Continuing their approach to the metropolis, the
next day they came to Csarea, Acts 21:4, "The
house," then "entered into," was that of Philip,
there styled the Evangelist, one of the seven trustees,
who, under the name, rendered in the English translation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
by that of Deacon, at the recommendation of
the Apostles, had been chosen by universal suffrage,
for the management of the pecuniary affairs of the
Church. Here they took up their quarters: and here
a fresh scene awaited them.</p>

<p>In the person of a man, whose name was Agabus,
the Apostles and their associates had found, as we
have seen, an agent of approved talents, and usefulness:
to him they had been indebted, for the most
important service, of a temporal nature, which the
history of the church in those days furnishes:&mdash;the
supply of money already received, as above mentioned,
from the first-born daughter of the church&mdash;the
church of Antioch, in Syria. At this place, Csarea,
as a last resource, this same Agabus, or
another, was, as it should seem, dispatched to meet&mdash;at
any rate did meet&mdash;the self-appointed Apostle in
his way; and, in the character of a <i>prophet</i>, for so
<i>this</i> Agabus is styled, strained every nerve, in the endeavour
to divert the invader from the so anxiously
apprehended purpose.</p>

<p>Whoever he was, employed on this occasion, but
employed in vain, were all the treasures of his eloquence.
The Holy Ghost was once more, and by
name, set in array against Paul's Lord Jesus. The
powers of verbal and oral eloquence were not
thought sufficient: action&mdash;and not only of that sort
which, in the eyes of Demosthenes, was an object of
such prime importance, but even pantomime&mdash;was
employed in aid. Acts 21:11. As to argument&mdash;fear
in the bosom of the Church, for a life so precious, was
the only one, which the skill of the orator could permit
him to employ: as to fear for their own sakes, and
resentment for the injury which they were predestinated
to suffer,&mdash;these were passions, too strongly
felt to be avowed. "He took Paul's girdle," Acts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
21:11, "and bound his own hands and feet, and said,
Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at
Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle,
and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles."</p>

<p>Supposing the Agabus mentioned on this occasion,
to be the same Agabus as he who was mentioned on
the occasion of the apprehended dearth&mdash;supposing
this to be he&mdash;and no reason presents itself in favour
of the contrary supposition&mdash;well known indeed must
he have been to Paul, since it was by his means that
Paul was indebted for the opportunity of paying, to
Jerusalem, that second visit of his, from which, as we
have seen, so little fruit was reaped.</p>

<p>The singular circumstance here is, the manner, in
which, on this second occasion, mention is made of
this name&mdash;Agabus: "a certain prophet named Agabus,"
Acts 21:10. Whether this was, or was not, the
same as the former Agabus,&mdash;this mode of designation
presents itself as alike extraordinary. If he <i>was</i>
the same,&mdash;in that case, as, by the addition of the adjunct
"a certain prophet," a sort of cloud is thrown
over his identity,&mdash;so, by so simple an expedient as
that of the non-insertion of these redundant words,
the clouds would have been dispelled. If he was <i>not</i>
the same,&mdash;so expressive being the circumstances, by
which identity stands indicated&mdash;namely, the quarter
<i>from</i> whence the same; the quarter <i>to</i> which the
same; the importance of the mission, and the demand
for talents and influence, in both cases so great; on
this supposition, to prevent misconception, no less
obvious than urgent was the demand, for some mark
of distinction, to be added on this second occasion:
in a word, for that sort of mark of distinction, which,
on other occasions; may, in this same history, be seen
more than once employed: witness <i>that John</i>, twice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'distiguished'">distinguished</ins> by the name of <i>John, whose surname
was Mark</i>. Acts 22:25, <i>ib.</i> 25:37.</p>

<p>Hence a suspicion, nor that an unnatural one&mdash;that,
in this history, the part, in which the name Agabus
occurs for the first time, and the part, in which
that same name occurs for the second time, were not
the work of the same hand.</p>

<p>With or without the assistance of the Holy Ghost,
with the like importunity, though in a tone corresponding
to the difference of situation, was a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'dissuation'">dissuasion</ins>,
to the same effect, added, with one voice, by the
adherents, of whom the suite of the self-appointed
Apostle was composed, and by all the other Christians
then present. "And when we heard these
things," says the author of the Acts, "both we, and
they of that place, Csarea, besought him not to go
up to Jerusalem." Acts 21:12.</p>

<p>The Holy Ghost, whom all the rest of the Church
had for their advocate, was no equal match for the
Holy Ghost whom Paul had for his adviser. "What
mean ye," says he, "to weep and to break mine
heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also
to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."
Acts 21:13. To a Holy Ghost so highly seated, submission
from a Holy Ghost of inferior rank, was the
only course left. "When he could not be persuaded,
concludes the historian, we ceased, saying, The
will of the Lord be done."</p>

<p>Paul die at Jerusalem, for the name of the Lord
Jesus? He, Paul, this self-constituted Apostle, who,
upon his own showing, had never seen Jesus? for the
name of Jesus, forsooth, die at Jerusalem? at that
Jerusalem, at which the indisputable Apostles had
been, and continued to be, living and labouring, in
the service of that same holy name, each of them, or
they are much misrepresented, not less ready and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
willing, both to live and upon occasion to die for it,
than he could be? Was it then really to die for the
name of Jesus? was it not rather to live? to live for
his own name, for his own glory, for his own profit,
and for the pleasure of depriving of their flock those
shepherds of souls, by whom his pretensions had been
disallowed, his glory disbelieved, his advances received
with that distrust and jealousy, for which the
long and bitter experience they had had of him, afforded
so amply sufficient a warrant? men, in whose
eyes, though in the clothing of a shepherd, he was
still a wolf?</p>

<p>What was he to die for? By whose hands was he
to die? By no danger, since he had ceased to be
their declared persecutor, had any Christians, in
their character of Christians, whether disciples or
preachers, then, or at any time, been menaced;<a name="FNanchor_51_56" id="FNanchor_51_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_56" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
of no such danger, at any rate, is any, the slightest,
intimation ever to be found: if any danger awaited
him, it was by himself, by his own restless and insatiable
ambition, by his own overbearing and ungovernable
temper, that it was created. Had he but
kept to his agreement; had the whole of the known
world, with the single exception of Judea, been wide
enough for him: no danger would have awaited him:&mdash;he
and Jerusalem might have remained in peace.</p>

<p>What service that <i>they</i> could not, could <i>he</i> hope to
do to the cause? For doctrine, they had nothing to
do but to report the discourses; for proof, the miracles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
which they had witnessed. To this, what could
<i>he</i> add? Nothing, but facts, such as we have seen,
out of his own head,&mdash;or, at best, facts taken at second
hand, or through any number of removes from
<i>them</i>,&mdash;and, in an infinity of shapes and degrees,
travestied in their passage.</p>

<p>In this account, the curious thing is&mdash;that upon
the face of it, the Holy Ghost of prophet Agabus is
mistaken: nothing happened in the manner mentioned
by him: for, in the same chapter comes the
account of what did happen, or at any rate is, by this
same historian, stated as that which happened:&mdash;by
no Jews is the owner of the girdle bound: dragged
by the people out of the temple,&mdash;by that same people
he is indeed attempted to be killed, but bound he
is not: for, with his being bound, the attempt to kill
him is not consistent: binding requires mastery, and
a certain length of time, which killing does not: a
single blow from a stone may suffice for it.</p>

<p>As to the Jews delivering him unto the hands of
the Gentiles,&mdash;it is by the Gentiles that he is delivered
out of the hands of the Jews: of the Jews, the endeavour
was&mdash;to deprive him of his life; of the Gentiles,
to save it.</p>

<h5>PLAN OF THE APOSTLES FOR RIDDING THEMSELVES OF PAUL.</h5>

<p>In this important contest, the Holy Ghost of Agabus

Paul's Lord Jesus. He made his entry into Jerusalem,
Acts 21:17, and the very next day commenced

of perishing, he was driven, at last, as far as from
Jerusalem to Rome, but the particulars of which belong
not to the present purpose.</p>

<p>What <i>is</i> to the present purpose, however, is the
company, which, upon this occasion, he saw. James,
it may be remembered, was one of the three Apostles&mdash;out
of the whole number, the only three who, on the
occasion of the partition treaty, could be prevailed
upon to give him the right hand of fellowship. Into
the house of this James he entered: and there what he
saw was an assembly, met together for the purpose,
of giving him the advice, of which more particular
mention will be made in its place. It was&mdash;to clear
himself of the charge,&mdash;a charge made against him
by the Jewish converts,&mdash;of teaching all the Jews,
which are among the Gentiles, to forsake Moses, and
of inculcating that doctrine by his own example, Acts
21:20-24. Well! at this assembly who were present?
Answer&mdash;the Elders&mdash;all of them: of the Apostles
with the single exception of James, at whose house
it was held, not one: not even John,&mdash;not even
Peter:&mdash;the two other Apostles, by whom on their
part, the treaty had been entered into:&mdash;Peter, the
chief of the Apostles;&mdash;John "the disciple," John
19:26; 20:2; 21:7-20, whom Jesus loved. The nerves
of James it appears, from other tokens besides this,
were of a stronger texture than those of either of
these his two colleagues; he alone stood the brunt.
As for Peter, he had been so "withstood to his face"
by Paul on the occasion of his first visit, that he had
no stomach to be so withstood a second time.</p>

<p>James, it may be remembered, was the Apostle, at
whose motion, against the opinion and speech of
Peter, the resolution insisting upon certain Jewish
observances, on the part of heathen converts to the
Church, was carried.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>Here then, in support of the proposition maintained,
by James,&mdash;here, was an assembly of the
rulers of the Church convened: the Elders&mdash;the
elected coadjutors of the Apostles all of them present:
of the Apostles themselves, not one: James excepted,
whose presence, it is evident, could not, on
this occasion, be dispensed with. Of this assembly,
the object, and sole object, was&mdash;the insisting upon
Paul's taking, for the sake of the peace of the
Church, a certain measure. Now, the measure thus
insisted upon, what was it? The clearing himself of
a certain charge then mentioned. And this charge,
what was it? A charge&mdash;of which, consistently with
truth,&mdash;of which without such direct falsehood, as if
committed would be notorious,&mdash;he could not clear
himself. In this case, one of two things would absolutely
be the result. Either he would be rash enough
to commit the falsehood,&mdash;in which case his reputation
and power of disturbing the peace of the Church
would be at an end; or, shrinking from the summons,
he would virtually confess himself guilty: in which
case likewise, he would find his situation, in the midst
of an universally adverse multitude, no longer tenable.</p>

<p>For this clearance, a ceremony was prescribed to
him:&mdash;a ceremony, the effect of which was&mdash;to declare,
in a manner, beyond all comparison, more
solemn and deliberate than that of anything which is
commonly understood by the word <i>oath</i>,&mdash;that he had
not done anything, of that which he stood charged
with having done, and which it could not but be generally
known that he had done. Witness those Epistles
of his, which in another place we shall see, Ch. 12:&mdash;Epistles
in which he will be seen, so frequently,
and upon such a variety of occasions, and in such a
variety of language, not only proclaiming the needlessness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
of circumcision&mdash;its uselessness to salvation,&mdash;but,
in a word, on all points making war upon
Moses.</p>

<p>No course was so rash, that Paul would shrink
from it, no ceremony so awful, or so public that Paul
would fear to profane it. Of the asseveration, to
which he was called upon to give, in an extraordinary
form, the sanction of an oath, the purport was universally
notorious: the falsity, no less so: the ceremony,
a solemnity on which the powers of sacerdotal
ingenuity had been exhausted, in the endeavour to
render is efficaciously impressive. Place of performance,
the most sacred among the sacred: act of entrance,
universally public, purpose universally notorious;
operations, whatever they were, inscrutably
concealed from vulgar eyes: person of the principal
actor occasionally visible, but at an awful elevation:
time, requisite for accomplishment, Acts 21:27, not
less than seven days: the whole ceremony, effectually
secured against frequent profanation, by "charges"
too heavy to be borne by the united power of four ordinary
purses.<a name="FNanchor_52_57" id="FNanchor_52_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_57" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> With all the ingredients of the most
finished perjury in his breast,&mdash;perfect consciousness,
fixed intentionality, predetermined perseverance,
and full view of the sanction about to be violated,&mdash;we
shall see him entering upon the task, and persevering
in it. While the long drama was thus acting in the
consecrated theatre, the mind of the multitude was
accumulating heat without doors. The seven days
necessary, were as yet unaccomplished, when indignation
could hold no longer: they burst into the sacred
edifice, dragged him out, and were upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
point of putting him to death, when the interference
of a Roman officer saved him, and became the first
link in that chain of events, which terminated in his
visit to Rome, and belongs not to this place.</p>

<p>Thus much, in order to have the clearer view of the
plan of the Apostles, and of the grounds of it, from
which will be seen the unexceptionableness of it, it
seemed necessary for us here to anticipate. But such
rashness, with the result that followed&mdash;the Apostles,
in their situation, how could they have anticipated
it?</p>

<p>Baffled, in their former endeavours to keep the invader
from entering the holy city&mdash;that holy city,
with the peace of which his presence was so incompatible,
such was the course which they devised and
embraced from driving him out of it. For the carrying
of this measure into effect, a general assembly
of the governing body of the Church was necessary.
At this assembly had no Apostle been present, it
could not, in the eyes of the Church at large, have
been what it was necessary it should appear to be.
Though, of the whole number of the Apostles, no
more than one was present,&mdash;yet, his being the house
at which it was held, and the others, whether summoned
or no, being expected of course, by the disciples
at large, to be likewise present,&mdash;the Elders
being likewise "<i>all</i>" of them present,&mdash;this attendance
was deemed sufficient: as to the other Apostles&mdash;all
of them but the one whose presence was thus indispensable,&mdash;abhorrence,
towards the man, whose
career had in their eyes commenced with murder, continued
in imposture, and had recently been stained
with perfidy,&mdash;rendered the meeting him face to face,
a suffering too violent to be submitted to, when by
any means it could be avoided.</p>

<p>On this occasion, the opinion, which, as we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
seen, cannot but have been entertained by them, concerning
Paul and his pretensions to Revelation, and
to a share equal to their own in the confidence of
Jesus,&mdash;must not, for a moment, be out of mind.</p>

<p>The whole fellowship of the Apostles,&mdash;all others,
to whom, at the time, anything about the matter was
known, believed his story to be, the whole of it, a pure
invention. In their eyes it was a fabrication: though
we, at this time of day&mdash;we, who of ourselves know
nothing about it, take for granted, that it was all true.</p>

<p>For proving the truth of it, all we have are his own
accounts of it: his own accounts, given, some of
them, by himself directly: the rest ultimately, his being
the only mouth from which the accounts we have
seen in the <i>Acts</i> could have been derived. Bearing
all this in mind, let us now form our judgment on the
matter, and say, whether the light, in which the Apostles
viewed his character and conduct, and the course
pursued by them as above, was not from first to last,
not only conformable to the precepts of their master,
but a model of patience, forbearance, and prudence.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3><i>Paul disbelieved continued.&mdash;His Fourth Jerusalem
Visit continued. His Arrival and Reception.<br /> Accused
by all the Disciples of the Apostles, he commences
an exculpatory Oath in the Temple.<br />
Dragged out by them&mdash;rescued by a Roman Commander&mdash;sent
in Custody to Rome.</i></h3>

<h4>SECTION 1.</h4>

<h5>AT JERUSALEM, PAUL IS RECEIVED BY THE ELDERS AND
JAMES, BUT BY NO OTHER APOSTLE.</h5>

<p>Spite of the opposing Holy Ghost,&mdash;spite of the
Apostles, and their prophet,&mdash;there he is at Jerusalem.
Now comes an incident&mdash;or say, rather, a relation&mdash;which
is altogether curious.</p>

<p>At "Jerusalem," says the history, "the brethren
received us gladly," Acts 21:17. The brethren?
what brethren? the brethren, by whom Agabus, with
his stage-trick, had been sent some sixty or seventy
miles' journey, in the endeavour to keep him at a distance?
the thousands of Jews thereupon immediately
mentioned? those Jews, who, though believers in
Jesus, are not the "less zealous of the law," and enraged
at Saul for those breaches of it, with which he
is charged?</p>

<p>That, by such of them, if any, by whom&mdash;by the appearance
he made, with his suite, it had happened to
be more or less overawed,&mdash;that by these, an appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
of gladness was assumed, seems credible
enough: look for those, by whom he could have been
received with real gladness&mdash;they will not, it should
seem, be very easy to be found.</p>

<p>Not, till the next day after his arrival, do Paul and
his suite present themselves to any in authority in
this spiritual commonwealth. The first person, to
whom, on this occasion, he presents himself, is James:
that one of the Apostles, who, with the exception of
Peter, is the person, and the only person, with whom
Paul has, on the occasion of any of his visits, been
represented as holding converse. Not with this
James&mdash;not with any settled inhabitants of Jerusalem&mdash;has
he had his lodging: only with Mnason,<a name="FNanchor_53_58" id="FNanchor_53_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_58" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
a man of Cyprus, whom, lest lodging should be wholly
wanting, they had brought with them from Csarea.
Of this so extensively apprehended arrival, there
had been full time for ample notice: among the rulers,
those, who, as well as James, chose to see him, were
all present. Who were they? the elders&mdash;"all the
elders." Of the Apostles, not so much as one, besides
James. Let it not be said, that, under the word
<i>elders</i>, the Apostles were meant to be included: on
other occasions, on which elders are mentioned, Acts
15:4; 6:23, the Apostles are mentioned, as forming a
body, distinct, as they naturally would be,&mdash;distinct
from these same elders.</p>

<p>Salutations performed, he addresses the assembly
in that strain, which was so familiar to him: boasting
upon boasting, and, above all things, boasting
that he does not boast: "declaring," says his historian;&mdash;declaring?
what? declaring what was his business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
at Jerusalem? declaring what service, in his eyes
the cause stood in need of, at his hands? Not he, indeed:
to any such effect, declaration might not have
been altogether so easy. What he declared, and that
"<i>particularly</i>," was&mdash;what "things God had wrought
among the Gentiles by his ministry." Exactly on
this, as on his last preceding visit,&mdash;when all, but
himself, were speaking to the question before him&mdash;Peter
on one side; after him, James on the other side&mdash;nothing,
is either he, or his companion Barnabas,
represented as saying, that belongs to the question;
nothing, but "declaring what miracles and wonders,
God had wrought among the Gentiles by them."
Between what is represented, as having been said on
the two occasions,&mdash;one difference, and no more than
one, is visible. On the former occasion, "miracles
and wonders"; on this latter occasion, no miracles
no wonders:&mdash;nothing more than <i>things</i>. Supposing
any of them particularized&mdash;neither miracles nor
wonders had, it should seem, been fortunate enough
to obtain credence: for that reason, it should seem,
that, on this occasion, all mention of them is dropped.</p>

<p>Hearing of these <i>things</i>, what did these elders?
Being things that "God," as they were informed,
"had wrought," they could do no less than glorify
"the Lord." Acts 21:19-20. As in Paul's Epistles,
so here, in the Acts,&mdash;by <i>the Lord</i>, it is Jesus, who, as
far as it appears, is the person, all along meant to be
designated. Here, <i>God</i>, it may be observed, is the
person, by whom everything good, that is done, is
done: Jesus&mdash;the Lord Jesus&mdash;the person, who is
<i>glorified</i> for it.</p>

<p>To make his boasts, was <i>his</i> business with <i>them</i>:
but, to subscribe to those same boasts, was not <i>their</i>
business with <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>Their business was&mdash;to inform him, of the storm of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
unpopularity, which by his audacity he had brought
upon himself: to inform him of the storm, and to
point out the only course, which, in their view of the
matter, presented a chance for his escape from it.
"Thou seest,"&mdash;say they,&mdash;"thou seest how many
thousands of Jews there are which believe; and
they are all zealous of the law. And they are
informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews
which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses;
saying, that they ought not to circumcise their
children, neither to walk after their customs," Acts
21:20. "What is it, therefore?" add they, "the
multitude must needs come together: for they will
hear that thou art come."</p>


<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 2.</h4>

<h5>LOW TONE ASSUMED BY HIM ON THIS OCCASION.</h5>

<p>On more accounts than one, remarkable,&mdash;and not a
little instructive, is the account we have of this last
recorded visit: and, in particular, as to what concerns
the reception he experienced from the ruling
powers of the Church.</p>

<p>It is, in some particulars, more especially to be
depended upon,&mdash;inasmuch as, at this important
meeting, the author of the Acts&mdash;if he is to be believed&mdash;was
himself present.</p>

<p>The first remarkable circumstance is&mdash;that, on this
occasion, Paul, the self-elected Apostle&mdash;instead of
taking the lead, and introducing his companions&mdash;keeps
behind, and is introduced <i>by them</i>: such was
the pliancy, with which&mdash;even on this expedition, of
invasion and projected conquest,&mdash;an expedition,&mdash;undertaken,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
in spite of everything that could be done,
both on the part of the intended objects of the conquest,
and on the part of his own adherents&mdash;such
was the pliancy, with which this man, among whose
boasts was that of being all things to all men, could
bend himself to circumstances.</p>

<p>Acts 21:15-18. "And after those days, we took up
our carriages, and went to Jerusalem. There went
with us, also, certain of the disciples of Csarea,
and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'and'">an</ins>
old disciple, with whom we should lodge." At
Jerusalem, not so much as a house, to harbour them,
could they have been assured of, but for this old disciple&mdash;fellow
countryman, of Paul's old patron, the
Son of Consolation, Barnabas. Not even with him
could they have been assured of this token of friendship,
had he not either been already of their party, or
detached himself to meet them, and afford them the
assurance: although, at Csarea,&mdash;from some cause,
of which, while the effect is brought to view, no intimation
is given,&mdash;they were fortunate enough to obtain
a hospitable reception, Acts 21:8, at the house of
Philip. This, however, be it observed, was not Philip,
the Apostle, whether it may have been Philip, styled
here the Evangelist:&mdash;one of the seven trustees, or
directors, Acts 6:5, to whom, with his six colleagues,
under the name, so inexpressively rendered, in the
English, by the word <i>Deacons</i>,&mdash;the management of
the common fund had, by the suffrages of the disciples,
been committed, must be left to conjecture.</p>

<p>17. "And when we were come to Jerusalem, the
brethren," Acts 21:17, "received <i>us</i> gladly." What
<i>brethren</i>? The Apostles, or any one of them? no:
The elders? no. Who then?&mdash;Who, but such of the
members of the Church, as, notwithstanding the general
repugnancy,&mdash;as testified at Tyre, and afterwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
by prophet Agabus, at Csarea,&mdash;could, by
the influence of the Cypriot Mnason, or otherwise, be
prevailed upon to see them.</p>

<p>And, <i>to</i> whom was it, that this sort of reception,
whatsoever it was, was afforded? Was it to Paul?
No: it was to <i>those</i>, who, on other occasions, were
with <i>him</i>; but, with <i>whom</i>, on this occasion, his prudence
forced his pride to submit to be.</p>

<p>Witness the next verse, Acts 21:18; "And the day
following," not till the day following, "Paul went
in with us unto James." <i>With them</i>&mdash;with these his
attendants&mdash;did Paul, then and there, go in:&mdash;not
<i>they with him</i>.</p>

<p>At the house of James&mdash;mark well, now&mdash;who were
the persons present? Answer&mdash;"all the elders."
But, forasmuch as these elders were, <i>all</i> of them,
present,&mdash;notice, within the compass of the two fragments
of two days,&mdash;notice, to and by all of them
must have been given and received: for it has just
been seen, whether, between any of them, on the one
hand,&mdash;and Paul, or, so much as any one of his attendants,
on the other,&mdash;there could have been any
such sort of good understanding, as to have produced
any the least personal intercourse, but at, and on,
the occasion of the general and formal meeting:&mdash;a
meeting, which&mdash;as will be seen presently&mdash;had, for
its sole object, the imposing upon him, in the event
of his continuance at Jerusalem, an obligation: an
obligation&mdash;to a man in his circumstances&mdash;it has
been seen, of how perilous and repulsive a nature.</p>

<p>Such, then, was the notice, as to have brought to
the place, all the Elders&mdash;All the Elders?&mdash;good.
But, these <i>Elders</i>&mdash;Elders among the <i>disciples in ordinary</i>,&mdash;on
an occasion such as this, what were <i>they</i>
in comparison of the Apostles&mdash;the only known
chosen servants, and constant companions of Jesus?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
Well, then, while&mdash;at this meeting&mdash;this formally convened
meeting&mdash;those Elders were, every one of
them, present&mdash;what was the number of <i>Apostles</i>
present? Answer&mdash;Besides James, not one.</p>

<p>And&mdash;why James?&mdash;manifestly, because it was at
<i>his</i> house, that the meeting was held.</p>

<p>And&mdash;why at <i>his</i> house? Because, on the occasion,
and for the purpose, of the <i>partition treaty</i>,&mdash;that
treaty, so necessary to the peace of the Church,&mdash;on
the one hand; and, to the carrying on of Paul's
scheme of dominion, on the other hand;&mdash;James was
one, of the only three, who could ever endure the
sight of the self-declared Apostle: Peter and John,
as hath been seen, being the two others:&mdash;and, because,
when, for the purpose of investing the meeting,
in the eyes of the disciples at large, with the character
of a meeting of the ruling administrative body&mdash;the
Apostles,&mdash;less than that one, if there were any,
there could not be. This one, James&mdash;under the pressure
of the present emergency&mdash;prevailed upon himself
to be: and, to be so irksome an intercourse&mdash;notwithstanding
the obviousness of the demand for as
great a number, as could be collected, of that primarily
influential body&mdash;of no other of the Apostles,
could the attendance be obtained: not even of Peter,
who, on a former occasion, had brought himself to endure
the hateful presence.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 3.</h4>

<h5>POSTERIOR TO ALL HIS SUPPOSED MIRACLES, HIS SILENCE
PROVES THEM UNREAL.</h5>

<p>Now, then, as to <i>miracles</i>. Had Paul, really and
truly, ever received from Jesus, any such preeminent
and characteristic appendage and mark of
Apostleship,&mdash;here, of all others, was an occasion, on
which it concerned him to make proof of it. Here was
an occasion, on which, with the design, and for the
purpose&mdash;the palpable, and almost universally and
so strenuously opposed design and purpose&mdash;of constituting
himself the superior of the Apostles, he was
presenting himself&mdash;though in circumstances of such
humiliation&mdash;in the character of an equal, with whom
they had treated on equal terms. Here&mdash;in order to
impose silence on all gainsayers&mdash;here was the occasion,
for his bringing to public view, this most important
of all items in the list of his credentials. The
Apostles, to whom&mdash;without any exception, by Jesus,
if the Evangelist, Mark 16:15-18, is to be believed&mdash;this
power had, previously to his ascension, been imparted,&mdash;these,
if any, were the men&mdash;not to say the
only men&mdash;qualified to form a judgment on the question&mdash;whether,
by any other individual, and, more especially,
by the individual before them, namely, by
this their self-declared colleague, any such extraordinary
power had, on any, and what, occasion, been
exercised or possessed. Of all imaginable occasions,
this was the one, on which he had most at stake, in the
being able to make proof of so matchless an endowment:&mdash;of
an endowment, which in the character of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
proof, in support of all his claims, would, in the very
nature of it, have been so perfectly <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'irrestible'">irresistible</ins>.</p>

<p>Well, then: this proof of his title&mdash;did he use every
endeavour, or make any offer, to produce it? No:
not so much did he venture upon, as, in any the most
general terms, to assert, or, so much as insinuate, the
existence of it. According to his own statement, what
was the general description of the tokens brought forward
by him, for the purpose of obtaining acceptance?
Were they <i>signs and wonders</i>? Oh, no! His
historiographer, indeed&mdash;in that, or any other such
indeterminate, and conveniently ambiguous phrase&mdash;his
historiographer, at some twenty or seven-and-twenty
years' distance, might venture, Acts 14:3, to
speak of his exploits&mdash;of the effects produced by his
exertions: in the like terms, in writing to his Corinthian
disciples, he might, even himself, venture, for
once, to speak of his own exploits.<a name="FNanchor_54_59" id="FNanchor_54_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_59" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> But, before an
assembly, so composed, was this boast, loose, and conveniently
ambiguous, as it was,&mdash;in his eyes, too
much to venture. Acts 21:19&mdash;Behold here the passage:
"And when he had saluted them, he declared
particularly"&mdash;what? what&mdash;signs and wonders?
No: but simply&mdash;"what <i>things</i> God had wrought
among the Gentiles by his ministry."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>
<p>Had he hazarded so much as the general expression
of signs and wonders&mdash;well, and what were these
signs and wonders? give us, at any rate, something by
way of a sample of them? In any one of them, was
there anything supernatural? anything&mdash;beyond the
success, the extraordinary success&mdash;we are to understand,
your exertions were attended with? Questions,
to some such effect as this, which, in an assembly, so
composed, had he ventured upon any such expressions,
he could not but have expected to be annoyed
with.</p>

<p>The occurrences which, in the course of it, in the
character of <i>miracles</i>, he has ventured to present to
view, will have been seen in their place and order.
Yet,&mdash;notwithstanding the mention there respectively
and severally made of them&mdash;no mention of
them does he, in the account given by him of the
meeting, venture to put in his leader's mouth. Why?
because&mdash;forasmuch as, by Paul himself, no such
pretence was ventured to be made&mdash;the meeting was
too important, and too notorious, to render it safe
to advance any such matter of fact; the face being
false; or, that any such pretensions were really
made.</p>

<p>But, hereupon come two questions.</p>

<p>1. Had any such miracles been really wrought&mdash;was
it in the nature of things, that, on this occasion,
Paul should have omitted all mention of them? even
so much as the most distant allusion to them?</p>

<p>2. If any such intimation had really been given, by
the historian himself, is it in the nature of the case,
that, on this occasion,&mdash;he having been one of the witnesses,
in whose presence they had been performed,&mdash;all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
mention of such intimation should have been
omitted?</p>

<p>Well, then&mdash;suppose that to both these questions,
let it but be a negative answer or the true one, the
consequence is plain&mdash;no such miracles were wrought.
Yet, in his narrative, has this man&mdash;exhibiting himself,
at the same time, in the character of a <i>percipient</i>
witness, in relation to them&mdash;ventured to assert the
existence, one after another, of the whole list of these
particularized miracles, not to speak of the cluster of
unparticularized ones.</p>


<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 4.</h4>

<h5>ACCUSED BY THE DISCIPLES, HE COMMENCES, AT THE
RECOMMENDATION OF THE APOSTLES, AN EXCULPATORY
OATH IN THE TEMPLE.</h5>

<p>Such being in their eyes the danger; now comes
their expedient for the arresting of it. It is an altogether
curious one: and among those persons styled
<i>elders</i>&mdash;all the elders&mdash;to every sincere and pious
Christian it will naturally be matter of no small
satisfaction that no one of the whole fellowship of
the Apostles is to be found.</p>

<p>According to the description here given of it, the
expedient is of such a sort, that&mdash;but for the occasion
on which it is represented as being proposed,&mdash;scarcely
would it be possible to divine what is meant;
what it was that was proposed to be done; or, whatever
it was, what could be the use or effect of it?</p>

<p>"Do therefore this," Acts 21:23, continues the
speech attributed to these elders, "do therefore this
that we say to thee: we have four men which have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
a vow on them:&mdash;Them take, and purify thyself
with them, and be at charges with them, that they
may shave their heads: and all may know that
those things, whereof they were informed, are
nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly
and keepest the law.&mdash;As touching the Gentiles
which believe, we have written and concluded that
they observe no such thing, save only that they
keep themselves from things offered to idols, and
from blood and from fornication.&mdash;Then Paul," it
is added, "took the men, and the next day purifying
himself with them entered into the temple to signify
the accomplishment of the days of purification,
until that an offering should be offered for every
one of them."</p>

<p>In the terms of the historian, the matter of the
accusation in question is this: namely, "that thou,"
speaking to Paul, "teachest all the Jews which are
among the Gentiles to forsake Moses": it then divides
itself into two branches: one is&mdash;that "they
ought not to circumcise their children"; the other
is&mdash;that "they ought not to walk after the customs":&mdash;<i>i.
e.</i>, conform to any part of the habitual observances&mdash;acts
and forbearances together&mdash;prescribed
by the Mosaic law.</p>

<p>Such is the accusation: such the act charged upon
him, in the character of an offence:&mdash;the teaching
of the doctrine in question.</p>

<p>In regard to the question&mdash;whether the doctrine
he is thus said to have taught, had really ever been
taught by him,&mdash;much will depend upon the difference
between simple <i>permission</i> and <i>prohibition</i>: in
English, upon the difference between <i>need not</i> and
<i>ought not</i>. If,&mdash;in the doctrine, the teaching of
which is thus charged upon him as a crime,&mdash;simple
<i>permission</i> was included&mdash;if, in speaking of the converts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
in question, the saying was&mdash;that they <i>need</i>
not circumcise their children&mdash;that they <i>need</i> not
walk after these customs&mdash;this and no more;&mdash;in
this case, that the charge, such as it is, was true,
is altogether out of doubt:&mdash;if, on the other hand,
the act he was charged with, went so far as to the
teaching that they <i>ought</i> not to circumcise any of
their children, or that they <i>ought</i> not to walk after
the customs prescribed in the Mosaic law&mdash;on this
supposition, the truth of the charge will at any rate
not be quite so clear as in the other case.</p>

<p>According to the English translation, that which
is charged as an offence, was not committed, unless,
in the doctrine taught, a direct <i>prohibition</i> was contained:
to a doctrine importing nothing more than
a simple <i>permission</i> to abstain from the acts and
forbearances in question, the charge would not have
any application. Not thus unambiguous, however, is
the Greek original; either by prohibition, or by ample
permission, might the doctrine charged as criminal
have been taught.</p>

<p>Such is the description of the obnoxious practice,
with which Paul is here stated as having been
charged: the practice by which the odium is stated
as having been incurred.</p>

<p>But this imaginary guilt, in what view do they
mention it as imputed to him? In this view evidently,
viz., that at their recommendation he may
take that course, by which, in their view, he will
escape from the wrath of which he had become the
object. The effect thus aimed at is,&mdash;that the indignation
of which he is the object, may be made to
cease. How made to cease? in one or other of two
ways: for the nature of the case admits not of any
other: either by proving that <i>that</i> which he had been
supposed to have taught, had not in truth ever been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
taught by him, and thus, that no such offence as he
was charged with, had, in fact, ever been committed
by him; or that, if any such offence had been committed,
the practice recommended might be accepted
as an <i>atonement</i>: or rather as an assurance, that
whatever in his past conduct had given them offence,
would not be repeated by him in future.</p>

<p>When the supposed remedial practice has been
explained,&mdash;then immediately after comes, we see, a
more particular indication of the good effects, for the
production of which it is recommended. These are&mdash;in
the first place, that, whatsoever were the doctrines
he was charged with having taught it, it will be generally
known that no such doctrines were ever taught
by him: in the next place, that it will in like manner
be known, that by himself no such habitual offence
as that of an habitual violation of the law in question
was committed.</p>

<p>Such are the effects, stated as resulting from his
performing the ceremony, the performance of which
was thus recommended to him.</p>

<p>This ceremony we see: and what we see at the
same time is&mdash;that it could not be, in the nature of it,
productive of any such effects.</p>

<p>Here is a certain doctrine, which he had been
charged with having taught. If the case was, that
he had taught it; let him have purified himself ever
so purely, whatsoever was meant by purification,&mdash;let
him have purified himself ever so completely,
let him have paid ever so much money, let him have
shaved his head ever so close,&mdash;by any, or all of all
these supposed meritorious acts, how could that be
caused, not to have happened, which in fact had
happened? by what means could they afford proof of
his performance of any ceremony, other than those
very same purification ceremonies themselves?</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p>As to the purpose of furthering the temporal interest
of the individual in question; namely, by removing
the load of odium, with which at that time it
seems he was burdened,&mdash;how far, in relation to this
object, the expedient promised to be an effectual cure,
is more than at this time we can find any ground for
saying: as to any good purposes of any other kind,
that it was not in the nature of it to be productive
of any, may be pronounced without much danger
of error.</p>

<p>Here at any rate was a ceremony&mdash;a ceremony
the object of which was&mdash;to apply, to the purpose
of ensuring obsequiousness, the power of the religious
sanction.</p>

<p>The object, to which it was meant to apply that
form, comes, it may be seen, under the general denomination
of an <i>oath</i>. An oath is either assertory
or promissory: if it be an oath of the promissory
kind, it is called a <i>vow</i>. An oath which is not a vow
cannot respect anything but what is past: upon that
which is past, no human act can any longer exercise
any influence. A <i>vow</i> has respect to something
future&mdash;to the future conduct of him by whom the
vow is taken: and to this conduct a man, in and by
the taking of the vow, engages to give the form
therein mentioned.</p>

<p>Whatsoever, therefore, these ceremonies were in
themselves,&mdash;thus much seems plain enough, respecting
the immediate effect they were designed to answer:
namely, either the delivery of a certain species
of <i>evidence</i>, or the entering into an <i>engagement</i> to a
certain effect: the evidence being a denial of the act
charged: the engagement, a promise not to practice
any acts of the sort in question in future.</p>

<p>Whatsoever was the effect looked for, and intended,
by the ceremony,&mdash;thus much we know, if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
historian is here to be believed: namely, that, in conformity
to the advice, Paul betook himself to the
performance of it.</p>

<p>But, in so doing, thus much also we know: namely,
that he consented to, and betook himself to one of
two things: an act of perjury, if the effect of the
ceremony was to convey an assertion, that he had
never taught, that a Jew, on being converted to the
religion of Jesus, <i>need</i> not circumcise his children,
or walk after the Mosaic customs: an act of apostasy,
if the effect of it was an engagement never to teach
this same doctrine in future: an act of apostasy&mdash;and
for what? only to save himself from the displeasure
entertained towards him on unjust grounds
by a set of ill-advised and inconsistent disciples.</p>

<p>Under the general head of <i>Paul's Doctrines</i>, particular
title <i>Faith and Works</i>, it will be seen what
pains he had taken, on so many occasions, to weed
out of men's breasts, Gentiles and Jews together, all
regard for the Mosaic law&mdash;to cause them, in the
words of the charge, <i>to forsake Moses</i>. "By the
works of the law," says he in his letter to the
Galatians, Gal. 2:16, "by the works of the law shall
no flesh be justified."</p>

<p>In this same letter, and in the same paragraph,&mdash;he
speaks, of a speech which he had made, of a
reproof which, at Antioch, he had given to Peter:&mdash;given
to him, at a point of time long before the time
here in question, namely, that of his last preceding
visit&mdash;his third visit to Jerusalem,&mdash;this being the
fourth. Let us see, once more, on what occasion, and
for what cause, this reproof: we shall thereby be the
better enabled to judge&mdash;how far, supposing the
ceremony to have the effect of an assertory oath,&mdash;how
far that oath can have been conformable to the
truth.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p>Speaking of Peter, "Time was," he says, "when
he did eat with the Gentiles: but at Antioch, as
above, certain persons came from James": Gal.
2:12, 13, and then it was that "he, Peter, withdrew
and separated himself, fearing them which were of
the circumcision.&mdash;And the Jews," continues he,
"dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas
also was carried away with their dissimulation."
Of his return to Judaism, or at any rate of
the dissimulation which accompanied it, what is the
judgment which, if he is to be believed, he pronounced?
Answer, That in so doing "they walked
not uprightly according to the truth of the Gospel."
Thereupon it is, that he charged Peter with inconsistency,
and reproved him for it: "Because," says
he, "he was to be blamed." Gal. 2:14. "When I
saw that they walked not uprightly according to
the Gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If
thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of the
Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest
thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?"</p>

<p>Before me lies a book by Thomas Lewis, M. A., in
four 8vo volumes, entitled <i>Origines Hebraicae</i>. In
this book, under titles <i>Vow</i> and <i>Purification</i>, my expectation
was, to find some explanation of this matter:
as also of the other <i>vow</i> taken by Paul at Cenchrea,
Acts 17:18, in the interval between his third
visit to Jerusalem, and this fourth: but no mention
is made of either: nor does anything appear, by
which any light can be reflected upon either.</p>

<p>On the four men, whom, in pursuance of the recommendation
in question, Paul is said to have taken,
that he might "purify himself along with them,"
the intended effect of the ceremony in question is
said to be&mdash;the making or performance of a <i>vow</i>.
But, from the circumstance of its being a vow in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
their case, it follows not absolutely that it may not
have been an oath&mdash;an assertory oath, in his case.</p>

<p>At Jerusalem, for the taking or performance of a
vow, a man was received into the temple:&mdash;a district
more extensive by far, it appears, than the district
called <i>Rules of the King's Bench</i> at London: from
the account given by Lewis, as well as by this,&mdash;it
appears that, on every such occasion, fees were taken
by the priests. As to the four men here in question&mdash;having
already, as it is stated, a vow on them, but
nothing as yet done in consequence,&mdash;it looks as if it
had been by poverty that they had hitherto been kept
from the accomplishment of their purpose: on which
supposition, Paul being the head of a considerable
party, and as such having a command of money,&mdash;part
of the recommendation seems to have been&mdash;that,
to acquire the reputation of liberality, he should
open his purse to these his proposed companions, and
pay their fees.</p>

<p>On the occasion here in question, whatsoever was
the purpose and intended effect of the ceremony,
what appears from verse 27, Acts 27, is&mdash;that seven
days were regarded as necessary for the accomplishment
of it: no mention of this in Lewis.</p>

<p>On this occasion, by the author of the Acts, once
more is mentioned the conciliatory decree of the
Apostles and Elders. Still, not a syllable about it
is to be found in any Epistle of Saint Paul, or in any
other of the Apostolical Epistles that have come
down to us.</p>

<p>Humanly speaking,&mdash;in what motives, in what circumstances,
in what considerations, shall we say, that
the causes, final and efficient, of this temperament&mdash;this
<i>mezzo termino</i>&mdash;this middle course&mdash;are to be
found? The answer that presents itself is as follows:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p>Two stumbling-blocks were to be steered clear of:&mdash;the
scruples of the Jewish converts, and the refractoriness
of the Gentiles. So far as regarded
abstinence from idolatrous feasts, and from meat
with the whole blood in it, killed and dressed in a
manner other than that in practice among the Jews,&mdash;conformity,
it was judged, need not be dispensed
of, at the hands of the Gentiles: and, so long as they
would be content with meat killed and dressed after
the Jewish mode,&mdash;the Jewish teachers might, without
giving offence to their Jewish converts, have the
convenience of partaking of the tables of the Gentile
converts. As to the rest&mdash;the endless train of habitual
observances, by which so large a portion of a
man's life was occupied and tormented, neither these
permanent plagues, nor the initiatory plague of circumcision,
though the affair of a minute, and performed
once for all, were found endurable: neither
upon himself nor upon his children would a man
submit to have it practiced.</p>

<p>After all, if the author of the Acts is to be believed,&mdash;it
was by the Jews of Asia, and not by those of
Jerusalem, that, at Jerusalem, the tumult was raised,
by which this purification of Paul's was rendered
incomplete, and his stay at Jerusalem cut short: he
being removed for trial to Rome; at which place the
history leaves him and concludes.</p>

<p>Of the behaviour observed by the Jerusalem Christians,
on that occasion&mdash;Apostles, Elders, Deacons
and ordinary brethren all together&mdash;nothing is said.
Yet, of these there were many thousands on the spot,
Acts 21:20: all of them of course informed of the
place&mdash;the holy place,&mdash;in which, at the recommendation
of the Elders, Paul had stationed himself. By
the Jews of Asia were "all the people on this occasion
stirred up," Acts 21:27: yet, among so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
thousands, no protection, nor any endeavour to afford
him protection, for aught that appears, did he
experience. Yet Asia it was, that had been, to the
exclusion of Judaea, the theatre of his labours: from
Asia it was, that the train of attendants he brought
with him, were come&mdash;were come with him to these
brethren&mdash;"the brethren,"&mdash;as if it had been said,
<i>all</i> the brethren,&mdash;by whom, according to the author
of the Acts, they were "received so gladly."</p>

<p>At this period ends all that, on the present occasion,
it will be necessary to say, of this last recorded
visit to Jerusalem. Of the two inconsistent accounts
said to have been given by him of his conversion&mdash;one
to the Jerusalem mob, the other to King Agrippa&mdash;full
notice has been taken under the head of his
conversion: of the miracles ascribed to him at Malta,
mention is here made, in the chapter allotted to the
history of his supposed miracles. Of any other
subsequent acts or sayings of his, no notice will
require to be taken in this place. The matter here in
question has been&mdash;the sort of relation, stated as
having had place, between this self-constituted Apostle,
and those who beyond controversy were constituted
such by, and lived as such with, Jesus himself:
and to this have incidentally been added the causes,
which have continually been presenting themselves,
for suspicion, in respect of the verity and authenticity,
or both, of the history, which, under the name
of the Acts of the Apostles, has come down to us,
connected by the operations of the bookbinder, in
the same volume with the several histories of the
four Evangelists, and the Epistles&mdash;not only of Paul
himself but of others among the Apostles; and with
the work styled, as if in derision, "<i>The Revelations</i>."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 5.</h4>

<h5>THE DESIGN OF THIS RECOMMENDATION JUSTIFIED.</h5>

<p>But the Apostles&mdash;says somebody&mdash;what are we to
think of the Apostles? If by Paul a <i>perjury</i> was
thus committed, were they not&mdash;all of them who
joined in this recommendation&mdash;so many <i>suborners</i>
of this same perjury?</p>

<p>The answer will, it is hoped, by most readers at
least, have been anticipated.&mdash;Yes or no, if so it be,
that it was their expectation that he would commit
it: no, assuredly; if it were their expectation&mdash;their
assured expectation&mdash;that he would <i>not</i> commit it:
that, even in his person, even after all they had witnessed
in him, the union of profligacy and rashness
would never soar to so high a pitch. The necessity
they were under, of ridding themselves of his presence
was extreme:&mdash;of ridding <i>themselves</i>&mdash;and,
what was so much more, their <i>cause</i>. Stay in the
same town, and in the same company with them, he
could not,&mdash;without being either their known <i>adversary</i>,
or their known <i>associate</i>. Their known <i>adversary</i>
he could not be, without either continuing himself
to be an object of universal horror, or else rendering
<i>them</i> objects of horror, to the whole body of
their disciples. Their <i>associate</i> he could not be, without
involving <i>them</i> in that odium, with which he himself
was, by the confession of his own adherent and
historiographer, covered. Under these circumstances,
not to speak of the cause of mankind, for saving
<i>themselves</i> and <i>their</i> cause from destruction,&mdash;what
course could they take, so gentle, and at the same
time, to all appearance, so surely effectual, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
proposing to him this test?&mdash;a test, which no man
could rationally expect, that any man in his circumstances
would take.</p>


<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 6.</h4>

<h5>DRAGGED OUT OF THE TEMPLE BY JEWS OR CHRISTIANS,
HE IS SAVED BY A GENTILE, NAMELY, A ROMAN
COMMANDER.</h5>

<p>With this occurrence concludes so much of Paul's
history, as,&mdash;for the purpose of perfecting the demonstration
given, of the disbelief manifested towards
his pretensions to a supernatural intercourse with
the Almighty,&mdash;it was found necessary here to anticipate.</p>

<p>In the matter of the chapter&mdash;the 13th&mdash;in which
Paul's supposed miracles are brought to view,&mdash;his
history is, as to all those particulars which seemed
necessary to be brought to view for the purpose of
the present inquiry,&mdash;deduced to very near the time,
at which the historian of the Acts, having conducted
him to Rome, leaves him there: leaves him there, and
with no other notice, than that of his having, at the
time, at which the history closes, passed two years
at that capital, in a sort of ambiguous state between
freedom and confinement: waiting to receive, at the
hands of the constituted authorities, the final determination
of his fate.</p>

<p>Meantime, lest anything should be wanting, that
could have contributed to the elucidation on a point
of such supreme importance, follows in the next chapter
a concluding and more particular view of the
grounds, on which, on the occasion of his visit to
the temple, the intention of deliberate perjury was
found necessary to be imputed to him.</p><hr class="tb" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>

in the Temple.</i></h3>

<h4>SECTION 1.</h4>

<h5>GENERAL PROOF OF THE PERJURY FROM THE ACTS.</h5>

<p>We have seen the indignation produced by Paul's
invasion of the dominion of the Apostles: we have
seen it carried to its height, by his commencement
of, and perseverance in, the exculpatory ceremony,
for the purpose of which he made his entrance, and
took up his lodgment in the temple. We have seen
the fruits of that same indignation: we have seen
the general result of them. What remains is&mdash;to
give a clearer and more explicit conception, than
can as yet have been given, of the <i>cause</i> of it.</p>

<p>This was&mdash;neither more nor less, than an universal
persuasion&mdash;that the assertion,&mdash;to which, on his
part, this ceremony had for its object the attaching
the sanction of an oath,&mdash;was, to his full knowledge,
false: the oath employed being, in its form, beyond
comparison more impressive, than any that has been
known to be at any time in use, in this or any other
country: and that, accordingly, the confirmation
given to the falsehood, in and by means of that most
elaborate and conspicuous ceremony, was an act of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
<i>perjury</i>: of perjury, more deliberate and barefaced,
than anything, of which, in these days, any example
can have place.</p>

<p>That, on this occasion, the conduct of the self-constituted
Apostle was stained with perjury, is a
matter, intimation of which has unavoidably come to
have been already given, in more parts perhaps of
this work than one. But, for a support to a charge,
which, if true, will of itself be so completely destructive
of Paul's pretensions&mdash;of all title to respect, at
the hands of every professor of the religion of Jesus&mdash;no
slight body of evidence could have been sufficient.</p>

<p>For this purpose, let us, in the first place, bring
together the several elementary positions, proof or
explanation of which, may be regarded as necessary,
and at the same time as sufficient, to warrant, in this
case, a verdict of <i>guilty</i>.</p>

<p>To these charges, is immediately subjoined such
part of the evidence, as is furnished, by the account
of the matter, as given in the Acts: in another section
will be brought to view the evidence, furnished
by Paul himself, in his Epistles. The evidence from
the Acts is of the <i>circumstantial kind</i>: the evidence
from the Epistles is <i>direct</i>.</p>

<p>1. To Paul was imputed as a misdeed, the having
recommended the forsaking of the Mosaic law. Recommended,
namely, to such disciples of his as, having
been born and bred under it, were found by him
settled in some Gentile nation. Proof, Acts 21:21,
... "They," 'the Jews which believe,' ver. 20, "are
informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews
which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses,
saying, that they ought not to circumcise their
children, neither to walk after the customs."</p>

<p>2. To a great extent, the imputation was well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
grounded: for, to a great extent, it had been his
practice, to give the recommendation thus described.
Of this position the proof will follow presently.</p>

<p>3. By Paul, the truth of this imputation was
utterly denied: denied by the opposite denegatory
assertion: and, the imputation being as above well
grounded,&mdash;in so far as any such denegatory assertion
had been made by him, he had knowingly uttered
a wilful falsehood.</p>

<p>4. In proof of the sincerity of this denial, it was
proposed to Paul, on the part of the Apostles and
Elders, to give a confirmation of it, by the performance
of a certain appropriate ceremony.</p>

<p>5. The ceremony thus proposed, was one that was
universally understood, to have the effect of attaching,
to any assertion, connected with it for the purpose,
the sanction of an oath.</p>

<p>6. Knowing such to be the effect of the ceremony,
he gave his assent to the proposition, and determined,
by means of it, to attach the sanction of an oath to
such his denial, as above: and thereby, the assertion
contained in that denial, being, as above, to his knowledge,
false,&mdash;to commit, in that extraordinary solemn
and deliberate form and manner, an act of perjury.</p>

<p>7. In pursuance of such determination, he accordingly
repaired for that purpose to the temple and had
his abode therein for several days: the completion of
the requisite number being no otherwise prevented,
than by the irruption of the indignant multitude, assured
as they were of his being occupied in the commission
of a perjury.</p>

<p>Proof of charges 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Acts 21:23, 24, 26,
27, 28.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>23. "<i>We</i>, the Apostles and the Elders, or at least
the Apostle James, ver. 18, have <i>four men</i>, which
have a <i>vow</i> on them;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<p>24. "Them take, and <i>purify thyself with them</i>,
and be <i>at charges</i> with them, that ... <i>all</i> may know
that those things, whereof they were informed
concerning thee, are <i>nothing</i>; but <i>that</i> thou thyself
also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.</p>

<p>26. "Then Paul took the men, and <i>the next day
purifying himself with them</i> entered into the temple,
to <i>signify</i> the accomplishment of the days of
purification, until that an <i>offering</i> should be offered
for every one of them.</p>

<p>27. "And when the <i>seven days were almost ended</i>,
the Jews, which were of Asia, when they saw him
in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid
hands on him.</p>

<p>28. "Crying out, Men of Israel, help; This is the
man, that teacheth all men everywhere <i>against</i>
the people, and <i>the law</i>, and this place: and further
brought Greeks also into the temple; and hath <i>polluted</i>
this holy place."<br /><br /></p></div>

<p>Of the perjuriousness of Paul's intent, a short
proof, namely of the circumstantial kind, is thus already
visible, in the indignation excited,&mdash;its intensity,
its immorality, and the bitter fruits of it. Will
it be said no? for that the indignation had, for its adequate
cause, his being thought to have spoken slightingly
of the law in question&mdash;it being the law of the
land,&mdash;and that, to this imputation, the ceremony, it
being, as above the performance of a <i>vow</i>, had no reference?
Assuredly no: no such interpretation will be
found tenable. True it is, that, by the persuasion,
that he had thus been dealing by the Mosaic law,&mdash;by
this persuasion, without need of anything else, the
indignation may well have been produced: but it
could only have been by the knowledge, that, upon
his having been called upon to confess the having so
done, or to deny it, he had, in this most extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
and universally conspicuous mode, given continuance
and confirmation to his denial&mdash;it could only have
been by <i>this</i> knowledge, that the excitement was
raised up to so high a pitch. For, What was it that
the information had charged him with? It was the
forsaking Moses. What was the purpose, for which
the recommendation was given to him&mdash;the recommendation
to perform this ceremony? It was the
<i>purifying</i> himself, "that all might know" that the
information was groundless. "That those things,"
say the Apostles with the Elders to him, "whereof
they," the thousands of Jews which believe, ver. 20,
"were informed against thee were <i>nothing</i>:"&mdash;"to
<i>purify thyself</i>," says the official translation: more
appositely might it have said <i>to clear thyself</i>: for in
that case, the idea of an <i>imputation</i> would clearly
enough, though but implicitly, have been conveyed:
whereas, to some minds, the idea conveyed by the
word <i>purify</i> may perhaps be no other than that of
some <i>general</i> cleansing of the whole character, by
means of some physical process, to which, in so many
minds, the psychological effect in question has, by the
influence of artifice on weakness, been attached.</p>

<p>Such then, namely, the clearing himself of the
imputation by so solemn a confirmation of the denial
of it,&mdash;such was the purpose, for which, in the most
unequivocal terms, his performance of the ceremony
was recommended: such, therefore, was the purpose
for which it was commenced; such, accordingly, was
the purpose for which it would have been consummated,
but for the interruption which it experienced:
experienced not from his hands, but from hands
among which, there seems sufficient reason to believe,
were the hands, if not of the very persons by whom it
had been recommended, at any rate of those who till
that time had been in use to be guided by their influence.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>

<p>To this interpretation, what objection is there that
can be opposed? If any, it can only be that which to
some minds may perhaps be suggested by the word
<i>vow</i>.</p>

<p>But the fact is&mdash;this word <i>vow</i> is a mistranslation:
the proper word should have been <i>oath</i>. By an oath
everyone understands at first mention an <i>assertory</i>,
not a <i>promissory</i>, declaration: by a <i>vow</i>, a <i>promissory</i>,
not an <i>assertory</i> one. But an <i>assertory</i> declaration,
as every one sees, is the only sort of declaration,
that admits of any application to the case in question.
By nothing that, in Paul's situation, a man
could <i>promise</i> to do, in addition to the performance
of the ceremony, could any evidence be given, of a
man's having, or not having, done so and so, in any
time <i>past</i>.</p>

<p>That by that which was actually done, that which
was essential was considered as having been done,&mdash;is
proved, by what is put into Paul's mouth in relation
to this subject, in his defence against the accusation
brought afterwards against him, before the
Roman governor <i>Felix</i>, by the spokesman of the Jewish
constituted authorities, <i>Tertullus</i>. There it is,
that, beyond all doubt, what he is speaking of, is his
<span class="smcap">CLEARANCE</span>, as above: for there also, the word in the
official translation, as well as in the Greek original,
is <i>purified</i>: in the past tense, purified. This being assumed,
it follows, as a necessary consequence, that
either in the course of that part, which at the time of
the irruption, was already elapsed of the <i>seven days'</i>
ceremony, in the temple; or, what seems more probable,
antecedently to the commencement of it, a denegatory
declaration&mdash;a declaration denying the fact
charged in the accusation,&mdash;had been made: for, that
the ceremony itself was never accomplished, is what
is expressly stated:&mdash;of the term of seven days stated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
as necessary to the accomplishment of it, no more
than a part, it is said, had elapsed, when the final interruption
of it took place.</p>

<p>To return to the time of Paul's entrance into the
temple.</p>

<p>Thus, as hath been seen, stands the matter, even
upon the face of the official English translation. But
in verse 26, the word employed in the Greek original,
removes all doubt. "Then," says the translation,
"Paul took the men, and the next day <i>purifying himself</i>
with them, entered into the temple." Purifying
himself, in the present tense, says the translation:
and, even this alone taken into consideration, the
purifying process, whatever it was, might be supposed
to have been but commenced before the entrance
into the temple, and as being thus as yet in
pendency, waiting the exit out of the temple for its
accomplishment. Thus it is, that, in the translation,
the verb is in the present tense, <i>purifying himself</i>:
but, in the Greek original, it is in the past tense, <i>having
purified</i> himself: so that, in the original, the
purification, whatever it may have been, is in express
terms stated as having, even before his entrance into
the temple, already accomplished.</p>

<p>Note that, if the historian is to be believed, he had
on this occasion, the fullest opportunity, of being, in
the most particular manner, acquainted with everything
that passed. For, when, as above, the recommendation
was given to Paul, on his appearance before
the Apostle James and the Elders,&mdash;he, the historian,
was actually present, "And the day following,"
says he, Acts 21:18, "<i>Paul went in with us unto
James</i>; and all the Elders were present."</p>

<p>Supposing <i>that</i> the true interpretation,&mdash;of what
use and effect then, it may perhaps be asked, was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
ceremony, of which the temple was the theatre? The
answer has been already given. It cannot have been
any other than the attaching, to the declaration that
had been made, the sanction, of an oath. Without the
ceremony performed in the temple, the declaration
was a declaration <i>not</i> upon oath, and as such not regarded
as sufficient evidence:&mdash;evidence, in the shape
which, the historian says, had been actually required
for the purpose: when the ceremony, of which the
temple was the theatre, had been gone through, and
the last of the number of days, required for its accomplishment
had been terminated;&mdash;then, and not
before, it was regarded as having been converted into
the appropriate and sufficient evidence. Thus it was,
that this seven days' ceremony was no more than an
elaborate substitute to the English ceremony of kissing
the book, after hearing the dozen or so of words
pronounced by the official functionary.</p>

<p>On this occasion, the Greek word rendered by the
word <i>vow</i>, is a word which in its ordinary sense was,
among Gentiles as well as Jews, exactly correspondent
to our word <i>prayer</i>. But, the idea denoted by the
word <i>prayer</i>, applies in this case with no less propriety
to an <i>assertory oath</i> than to a <i>promissory vow</i>.
Directly and completely, it designates neither. In
both cases an address is made to some supposed supernatural
potentate: in cases such as the present,
beseeching him to apply the sanction of punishment
to the <i>praying</i> individual, in the event of a want of
sincerity on his part: in this case, in the event of his
not having done that which, on this occasion, he declares
himself to have done, or, what comes to the
same thing, his having done that which he declares
himself <i>not</i> to have done: in the other case, in the
event of his not doing that which he has promised to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
do, or doing that which he has promised <i>not to do</i>.<a name="FNanchor_55_60" id="FNanchor_55_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_60" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a><br /><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p><p>All this while, it is not in a direct way, it may be
observed, that this word <i>vow</i> is employed, and application
made of it to Paul's case: not in speaking of
Paul himself in the first instance, but after speaking
of the <i>four other men</i>, whom it is proposed he should
take for his comrades, on his entrance into the temple.
"We have four men," James and the Elders
are made to say, Acts 21:23, 24, "We have four men
which have a vow on them: Them take, and purify
thyself with them ... that ... all may know, that
those things, whereof they," the multitude, ver. 22,
"were informed concerning thee, are nothing": no
otherwise, therefore, than by the case these four men
were in, is the case designated, in which it is proposed
to Paul to put himself.</p>

<p>As to the case these four men were in,&mdash;no otherwise
than on account of its connection with the case
Paul was in,&mdash;is it in anywise of importance. As
probable a supposition as any seems to be&mdash;that of
their being in the same case with him: accused, as
well as he, of teaching "Jews to forsake Moses:"
for, between their case and his, no intimation is given
of any difference: and, as the <i>"purifying himself"</i>
is what is recommended to him, so is it what they are
stated, as standing eventually engaged to do on their
part. If then, in <i>his</i> instance, purifying himself
means&mdash;clearing himself of a charge made against
<i>him</i>,&mdash;so in their instance must it naturally, not to
say necessarily, have meant&mdash;clearing themselves of
some charge made against <i>them</i>. Moreover, when,
as above, he is, in the Greek original, stated as having
actually purified himself, before his entrance into the
temple, so are they likewise; for it is "<i>with them</i>,"
that his purification is stated as having been performed.</p>

<p>This being assumed, it might not be impossible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
find a use for the word <i>vow</i>, even in its proper sense&mdash;its
<i>promissory</i> sense: for, what might be supposed
is&mdash;that before the entrance into the temple, at the
same time with the <i>denegatory declaration</i>, a <i>vow</i> was
made&mdash;a solemn <i>promise</i>&mdash;to enter into the temple,
and back of the declaration with the sanction of an
oath, by going through the ceremony. But, forasmuch,
as, in the import of the Greek word, no such
idea, as that of a <i>promise</i>, is comprised,&mdash;the only
use of this interpretation would be&mdash;to save the translators
from the imputation of an impropriety, with
which it seems rather more probable that they stand
chargeable.</p>

<p>All this while, of Paul's conduct on this occasion,
to what part was it that the blame belonged?&mdash;Surely,
not to the endeavour, to wean men from their attachment
to the Mosaic laws: for thus far he copied
Jesus; and in copying did not go against, but only
beyond, the great original. True it is, that, in so doing,
he served his own personal and worldly purposes:
not less so, that, in this subserviency, he found
the inducement by which his conduct was determined:
for, by how much stronger men's attachment would
continue to be to the dead lawgiver, by so much, less
strong would it be to the living preacher. But, in so
far as a man's conduct is serviceable to mankind at
large, it certainly is not rendered the less serviceable,
or the less laudable, by his being himself included in
the number. The blame lay then&mdash;not in teaching
men to forsake Moses: for, thus far, instead of being
blame-worthy, there was nothing in his conduct, that
did not merit positive praise. What there was amiss
in his conduct&mdash;in what, then, did it consist? Plainly
in this, and this alone: namely, that, on being taxed
with having so done,&mdash;instead of avowing and justifying
it, he denied it: and, having denied it, scrupled
not to add to the falsehood the aggravation of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
extraordinarily deliberate and solemn perjury, as
hath been so plainly visible. And, to what purpose
commit so flagrant a breach of the law of morality?
Plainly, to no other, than the fixing himself in Jerusalem,
and persevering in a project of insane and selfish
ambition, which, in spite of the most urgent remonstrances
that could be made by his most devoted
adherents, had brought him thither: for, he had but
to depart in peace, and the Apostles of Jesus would
have remained unmolested, and the peace of Christendom
undisturbed.</p>

<p>An article of evidence, that must not be left unnoticed,&mdash;is
the part taken, on this occasion, by the
historiographer. Nowhere does this eyewitness take
upon himself to declare,&mdash;nowhere so much as to insinuate&mdash;that
of the charge, thus made upon his hero,
there was anything that was not true: nowhere does
he so much as insinuate, that the declaration by which
he says Paul had cleared himself of the charge, and,
as we have seen, <i>before</i> his entrance into the temple
for the purpose of enforcing it by the sanction of an
oath,&mdash;was anything short of a downright falsehood.
After this, he makes a defence for Paul before Felix;<a name="FNanchor_56_62" id="FNanchor_56_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_62" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
he makes a defence for Paul before Festus;<a name="FNanchor_57_63" id="FNanchor_57_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_63" class="fnanchor">[57]</a><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">he makes a defence for Paul before Festus and</span><br />
Agrippa;<a name="FNanchor_58_64" id="FNanchor_58_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_64" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and, on no one of all those occasions, is
the defence anything to the purpose. He, indeed, makes
Paul declare, that he, Paul, had always been a strict
observer of the Mosaic ordinances. This may have
been either true or false: but, true or false, it was
equally foreign to the purpose. Not improbably, it
was, in a considerable degree, true: for if, while he
gave to other Jews his assurance, that the operations
in question, burthensome as they were, were of no
use, he himself continued to bear the burthen notwithstanding,&mdash;the
persuasiveness of his advice
would naturally be augmented by the manifestation
thus given of disinterestedness. It may accordingly
have been true: but, false or true, it was equally foreign
to the purpose: the question was&mdash;not what he
had done himself; but what he had recommended it
to others to do.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p><p>Thus&mdash;from everything that appears, by all such
persons as had the best means of information&mdash;the
charge made upon him was <i>believed</i>,&mdash;let it now be
seen, whether we should not be warranted in saying,
<i>known</i>,&mdash;to be true.</p>

<p>As to "<i>The Jews of Asia</i>,"&mdash;and the mention made
of this class of men, as the instigators of the tumult&mdash;can
any support be derived from it, for the inference,
that it was by something else in Paul's conduct,
and not by any such perjury as that in question, that
the vent, thus given to the indignation, was produced?<a name="FNanchor_59_65" id="FNanchor_59_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_65" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
No, assuredly: altogether inconsistent
would any such supposition be, with the main part of
the narrative. Whoever were the persons with whom
the manual violence originated;&mdash;whatever were the
reproaches cast upon the invader on other grounds;&mdash;the
purpose&mdash;the sole purpose&mdash;for which he entered
upon the ceremony, is rendered as plain as
words can make it. It was the clearing himself of the
charge of teaching Jews to forsake Moses: and, supposing
the fact admitted, everything, in the way of
justification, being, before such a tribunal, manifestly
inadmissible,&mdash;of no such charge was it possible
for him to clear himself, without denying the
truth of it. But, according to the historian, to confirm
this denial, by the solemnity, whatever it was,&mdash;was
the purpose, and the sole purpose, of it: of this,
the negative assertion, contained in the denial, being
untrue, and, by him who made it, known to be so,&mdash;confirming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
such denial, by the solemnity,&mdash;call it
<i>oath</i>&mdash;call it <i>vow</i>&mdash;call it anything else,&mdash;was committing
an act of perjury: and, to believe that such
his denial was false, and yet not believing him guilty
of perjury&mdash;at any rate, on the supposition of the accomplishment
of the solemnity&mdash;was not possible.
How numerous so ever may have been the other
causes of provocation, given by him&mdash;how numerous
so ever, the different descriptions of persons to whom
they had been given;&mdash;no disproof could, by all of
them put together, be given, by this solemnity, to
the denial in question,&mdash;supposing it false.</p>

<p>To the present purpose, the only question is&mdash;whether,
by Paul, on the occasion in question, an act
of perjury was, or was not, committed? not&mdash;what
was the cause, whether that, or any other, of any indignation
of which he was the object. Even therefore,
might it be allowed, that a <i>vow</i>, in the sense of which
it is contradistinguished from an <i>oath</i>, was performed
by him, or about to be performed,&mdash;still it
would not be the less undeniable, that it was for the
purpose of converting the simple declaration into a
declaration upon oath, that he entered upon the solemnity:
and that, therefore, if in the simple declaration
there was anything to his knowledge false, the
consequence is&mdash;that by his converting it into a declaration
upon oath, he rendered himself guilty of
perjury.</p>

<p>The observation, thus applied, to what is said of
the "<i>Jews of Asia</i>," will be seen to be applicable, and,
with equal propriety, to what is said about his being
charged with "bringing <i>Greeks into the temple</i>:" and,
in particular, about his being supposed to have
brought in "<i>The Ephesian Trophimus</i>:" and moreover,
what may, in this last case, be observable, is&mdash;that
this about the Greeks is expressly stated as being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
a <i>further</i> charge, distinct from the main one: nor yet
is it so much as stated, that, by any such importation,
to what degree so ever offensive, any such effect, as
that signified by the word <i>pollution</i> was produced.</p>

<p>Not altogether destitute of probability seems the
supposition, that these two circumstances&mdash;about the
Jews of Asia, and about Trophimus&mdash;may have been
thrown in, by this adherent of Paul's, for the purpose
of throwing a cloud of confusion and obscurity
over the real charge: and if so, the two circumstances,
with the addition of the three different defences, put
into the hero's mouth, on the three several occasions
of the endeavour,&mdash;must be acknowledged to have
been employed, not altogether without success.</p>

<p>Here then closes that part of the evidence, which,
to the purpose of a judgment, to be passed at this
distance of time from the facts, may be considered
as so much <i>circumstantial</i> evidence: in the next section
may be seen that part, which comes under the
denomination of direct evidence.</p>


<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 2.</h4>

<h5>PROOF FROM THE EPISTLES.</h5>

<p>We come now to the <i>direct</i> evidence: that evidence&mdash;all
of it from Paul's own pen:&mdash;all of it from his own
Epistles. It consists in those "teachings to forsake
Moses," which will be now furnished, in such unequivocal
terms and such ample abundance, in and
by those fruits of his misty and crafty eloquence:&mdash;in
the first place, in his letter to the disciples, which
he had made, or hoped to make at Rome:&mdash;date of it,
according to the received chronology, about four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
years anterior to the time here in question:&mdash;in the
next place, in two successive letters to the disciples,
whom, it appears, he had made at Corinth:&mdash;both
these addresses, set down, as belonging to the same
year as the one to the Romans. Moreover, in his so
often mentioned Epistle to the Galatians, matter of
the same tendency is to be found. But, this last being,
according to that same chronology, of a date posterior
by some years to the time, at which the charge of having
preached the sort of doctrine in question was, on
the present occasion, made,&mdash;it belongs not to the
present question, and is therefore left unemployed.
And, in the same case, is some matter that might be
found in his Epistles to the Thessalonians.</p>

<p>1. First then as to the Mosaic "law and customs,"
taken in the aggregate.</p>

<p>On this subject, see in the first place what the oath-taker
had said to his <i>Romans</i>.</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>Rom 15:14. "I know, and am persuaded by the
Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself;
but to him that esteemeth anything to be unclean,
to him it is unclean."&mdash;&mdash; 17. "For the kingdom of
God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and
peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost."</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Rom 3:20. "<i>By the deeds of the law there shall no
flesh be justified</i> in his, God's sight; for by the law
is the knowledge of sin."</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Rom. 3:27, 28, 29, 30, 31. "Where is boasting then?
It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay; but
by the law of the faith.&mdash;&mdash; Therefore, we conclude,
that <i>a man is justified by faith without the
deeds of the law</i>.&mdash;&mdash; Is <i>he</i> the God of the Jews
only? is <i>he</i> not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the
Gentiles also:&mdash;&mdash; Seeing it is one God, which
shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision
through faith.&mdash;&mdash; <i>Do we then make void</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
<i>the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish
the law.</i>"</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Rom. 10:9. "... if thou shalt confess with thy
mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine
heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou
shalt be saved.<a name="FNanchor_60_66" id="FNanchor_60_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_66" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>&mdash;&mdash; 12. For there is no difference
between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord
over all is rich unto all that call upon him.&mdash;&mdash;For
whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord
shall be saved."<a name="FNanchor_61_67" id="FNanchor_61_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_67" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p></div>

things: another who is weak, eateth herbs.&mdash;&mdash; Let
not him that eateth despise him that eateth
not; and let not him which eateth not judge him
that eateth; for God hath received him.&mdash;&mdash; <i>One

esteemeth every day alike.</i><a name="FNanchor_62_68" id="FNanchor_62_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_68" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>"</p></div>

all things are not expedient:" or <i>profitable</i> margin,
"all things are lawful for me, but I will not be
brought under the power of any.&mdash;&mdash; <i>Meats for the
belly</i>, and <i>the belly for meats</i>; but God shall destroy
both it and them."</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1 Cor. 8:8. "But <i>meat commendeth us not to God:
for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither if
we eat not, are we the worse</i>.&mdash;&mdash; Wherefore, if meat
make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while
the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend."</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1 Cor. 9:19-23. 19. "For though I be free from all
men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that
I might gain the more.&mdash;&mdash; <i>And unto the Jews I
became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews</i>; to
them that are under the law, as under the law, that
I might gain them that are under the law:&mdash;&mdash; <i>To
them that are without law, as without law</i>, being not
without law to God but under the law to Christ, <i>that
I might gain them that are without law</i>.&mdash;&mdash; To the
weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak:
I am made all things to all men, that I might by all
means save some.&mdash;&mdash; And this I do for the Gospel's
sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you."</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>2 Cor. 3:12 to 17. "Seeing then that we have such
hope, we use great plainness of speech.&mdash;&mdash; And not
as <i>Moses, which put a vail over his face, that the
children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the
end of that which is abolished</i>.&mdash;&mdash; But their minds
were blinded; for until this day remaineth the same
vail untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament;
which vail is done away in Christ.&mdash;&mdash; But
even unto this day, <i>when Moses is read, the vail is
upon their heart</i>.&mdash;&mdash; Nevertheless <i>when it shall
turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away</i>.&mdash;&mdash; Now
the Lord is that spirit; and where the spirit
of the Lord is, there is liberty."</p></div>

<p>Now as to <i>circumcision</i> in particular.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Rom. 2:25, 26, 27, 28, 29. "For <i>circumcision verily
profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
<i>breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.&mdash;&mdash; Therefore
if the uncircumcision keep
the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision
be counted for circumcision?</i>&mdash;&mdash; And
shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it
fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision
dost transgress the law?&mdash;&mdash;For he is
not a Jew, which is one outwardly, neither is that
circumcision which is outward in the flesh:&mdash;&mdash; But
he is a Jew, which is one inwardly: and circumcision
is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in
the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God."</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Rom. 3:1, 2. "What advantages then hath the
Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?&mdash;&mdash; Much
every way: chiefly, because that unto them
were committed the oracles of God."</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Rom. 4:9, 10, 11, 12. "<i>Cometh this blessedness
then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision
also?</i> for we say that faith was reckoned
to Abraham for righteousness.&mdash;&mdash; How was it then
reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision.
Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.&mdash;&mdash; And
he received the sign of circumcision, a seal
of the righteousness of the faith which <i>he had yet</i>
being uncircumcised: that he might be the father
of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised;
that righteousness might be imputed unto
them also:&mdash;&mdash; And the father of circumcision to
them who are not of the circumcision only, but who
also walk in the steps of that faith of our father
Abraham, which he had being <i>yet</i> uncircumcised."</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Rom. 15:8. "Now I say that Jesus Christ was a
minister of the circumcision for the truth of God to

<p>From any one individual, who, in either of these
distant cities, had seen any one of these same Epistles,&mdash;let
it now be seen whether information of their
contents, supposing it credited, would not have sufficed
to produce those effects, the existence of which
is so unquestionable. Not but that the same rashness,
which suffered him to furnish such abundant
evidence against himself in those distant regions,
could scarce fail to have given birth to credence in
abundance, of various sorts, and of a character,
which, on that occasion, would be much more impressive.</p><hr class="tb" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_55_60" id="Footnote_55_60"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55_60"><span class="label">[55]</span></a> On this occasion, supposing the purpose of this ceremony to
be, as here contended, no other than that of applying, to a declaration
concerning a matter of fact, the supernatural penal sanction, by
which it was converted into an oath,&mdash;a natural enough subject of
inquiry is&mdash;to what cause is to be attributed the extraordinary length
thus given to it?&mdash;seven days at the least; to which, upon examination,
would be found virtually added, as much greater a length of
time, as the holy person, to whose custody the oath-taker consigned
himself, might be pleased to prescribe. Answer, without difficulty,&mdash;the
affording time and pretence for the exaction of his <i>surplice fees</i>:&mdash;namely,
those established by law,&mdash;with the addition of others, to
as large an amount, as the need which the oath-taker had of the
accommodation thus to be afforded to him, could engage him to
submit to. As to the length of time,&mdash;in the passage in question,
the translation exhibits some obscurity: nor is it altogether cleared
up by the original. A determinate number of days, to wit, seven, is
indeed mentioned, ver. 27, but immediately before this, ver. 26,
comes a passage, from whence it seems unquestionable, that, whatever
were the time a man had been thus detained, he was not to be
let out, until, over and above what good things it had been made
necessary he should bring in with him, a further payment, and as it
should seem, in a pecuniary shape, had been made: "to signify,"
says ver. 26, "the accomplishment of the days of purification, until
that an offering should be offered for every one of them." "And
when <i>the seven</i> days were <i>almost</i> ended," continues ver. 27: immediately
after which comes the account of the tumult, by which they
were prevented from being <i>quite</i> ended.
</p>
<p>
As to the phrase&mdash;"<i>to signify the accomplishment of the days</i>,"
what seems to be meant by it is&mdash;to make known when the number
requisite for the completion of the train of operations had been
<i>accomplished</i>. But, to make known when that number had been
<i>accomplished</i>, it was <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'previoulsy'">previously</ins> requisite to make known when it
had <i>commenced</i>: and, for making <i>this</i> known, the act, probably a
public one, of making entrance into the temple, was employed.
</p>
<p>
As to the origin, as well as particular nature, of the ceremony,&mdash;though
no such word as <i>Nazarite</i> is here employed, on turning to
the Book of <i>Numbers</i>, chapter the sixth, it will be manifest, that
the ceremony here in question is the same as that, by which, according
to the receipt there given, any man whatever, whether, and any
woman also, must be left to conjecture, might be converted into a
<i>Nazarite</i>. <i>Nazarite</i> is from a Hebrew word, which meant originally
neither more nor less than a person <i>separated</i>. A person consigned
himself to the custody of "<i>the priest of the congregation</i>:" or, as
we should now say, the <i>parson of the parish</i>. The ceremony accomplished,
the patient was thereby put into a state of appropriate
sanctity: and, from this metamorphosis, as the priest and the Nazarite
could agree, any inference might be drawn, and any purpose
at pleasure accomplished. Neither to the <i>extent</i> of the inference,
nor therefore to the <i>purpose</i> designed, were any limits visible. Everything
depended upon the priest: for, though of certain particular
operations made requisite, a most particular list is given, all of them
of the most insignificant character in themselves, yet so thickly and
so plainly sown are the seeds of <i>nullity</i>, that, when all the appointed
fees, of which there is also an enormous list<a name="FNanchor_IV._61" id="FNanchor_IV._61"></a><a href="#Footnote_IV._61" class="fnanchor">[IV.]</a>, had been paid, it
would still lie at the option of the priest, to pronounce the whole
procedure null and void, unless, and until any such final compliment
as he chose to expect, were paid to him. Among the most obviously,
as well as extensively convenient purposes, to which it was capable
of being applied, is this of which the present case affords an example:
namely, the manufacturing of evidence: could he but find means
to satisfy the priest, a man might, to all legal purposes, and even to
the satisfaction of all appropriately disposed minds, prove, and with
conclusive effect, any thing to be false, which everybody knew to be
true. By fabrication, falsification, or suppression of evidence, what
is the right that may not be usurped? what is the wrong that may
not, with success and impunity, be committed?
</p>
<p>
In the Mosaic law, immediately before <i>this</i> institution Numbers,
chap. 5., comes another, by means of which every man, who was
tired of his wife, might, in another way, with the assistance of a
priest&mdash;and, for aught that appears, any priest&mdash;clear himself of
that incumbrance. All the man had to do was&mdash;to <i>say</i> he was "<i>jealous</i>"
of her: the priest thereupon took <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'chcarge'">charge</ins> of her. If priest and husband
were agreed, "<i>the water of jealousy</i>" did its office: if not, the
woman remained imprisoned. Against the superhuman evidence, afforded
by the purifying process here in question, no quantity of human
evidence was to be available. In like manner, to warrant this
poisoning process, not any the smallest particle of human evidence
was necessary: the case in which it is to be performed, is "<i>if there
be no witness against her, neither she be taken</i>," says the text, <i>Numbers</i>
5. 13. Verily, verily, not without sufficient cause, did Jesus, from
first to last, take every occasion, to weaken the attachment of the
people, to a system of law, of which those institutions afford two,
among so many samples. Yet, while in the very act of depreciating
it, is he represented as declaring his purpose to be the <i>fulfilling it</i>:
Matt. 5. 17. for, such was the verbal veil, which the prejudices he had
to encounter, rendered it necessary to him at the moment, to throw
over the tendency of his endeavors. Fulfill the very law he was
preaching against? Yes: but in one sense only: namely, by fulfilling&mdash;not
the real purpose of it,&mdash;the establishment of the corrupt despotism
of the priesthood,&mdash;but the professed purpose of it, the good
of the community: in regard to the law, fulfilling, in a word, whatever
there was that was good in it, whatever there was that deserved
to be fulfilled. Jesus, in whose opinion death was too severe
a punishment, for a wife, in the case of a breach, on <i>her</i> part, of a
contract, the breach of which was by the <i>other</i> contending party
practised with impunity&mdash;Jesus, who accordingly, in saving the offender,
exposed to merited disgrace the sanguinary law&mdash;was doubtless
still further from approving, that parish priests, in unlimited
numbers, should poison innocent women for the accommodation of
their husbands, or sell licenses to commit every imaginable wrong
by perjury.
</p>
<p>
<i>Vow</i> is <i>oath</i>: this is not the only occasion, in which the self-constituted
Apostle, if his historiographer is to be believed, took
the benefit, whatever it was, of this ceremony. In Acts 18:16, he
"<i>shaved his head</i>," it is said, at Cenchrea:&mdash;why?&mdash;"for he had
a vow upon him." What the vow was, we are not told; this, however,
we know, as well from Acts 21:26, as from Numbers 6, he
could not have got anything by it, had the parson of the parish
of Cenchrea been otherwise than satisfied with the "<i>offering</i>" that
was made.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_IV._61" id="Footnote_IV._61"></a><a href="#FNanchor_IV._61"><span class="label">[IV.]</span></a> In the bargain between vow-maker and vow-sanctifier, the
following list of fees, provided for sanctifier, by <i>Excellent Church</i>
of that country, in those days whatever they were,&mdash;may serve to
show the use of it to one of the contracting parties. To complete
our conception of the nature and effects of the arrangement, nothing
is wanting, but that which so unhappily must for ever remain
wanting&mdash;a history of the <i>purposes</i>, to which from the commencement
of the government to the dissolution of it, the solemnity had
been applied on the vow-maker's side. Of these purposes, we must
content ourselves as well as we can with the sample, for which we
are here indebted to the author of the Acts. The table of fees

IV. Mysterious addition, the liquidation of which must be left to
the Hebrew scholar. Ver. 21. "Besides <i>that</i> that his hand shall get:"
(whose hand? priest's or vow-maker's?) "according to the vow
which he vowed, so he must do after the law of his separation:"&mdash;probable
meaning, according to the purpose, for which he performed
the ceremony&mdash;the advantage which he looked for from it.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, by any one whose curiosity will carry him through the
inquiry, causes of <i>nullity</i> may be seen as sedulously and copiously
provided, as if by the <i>astutia</i> of an English judge, or pair of judges,
to whose profit the fees were to be received: effect of the nullity,
of course, repetition; necessity of repeating the process, as in case
of <i>new trial</i> or <i>arrest of judgment</i>, with the fees.
</p>
<p>
Religion was thus no less aptly served at Jerusalem, under Mosaic
institutions,&mdash;than Justice is to this day, under matchless constitution
and English institutions, at Westminster.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>More Falsehoods.&mdash;Resurrection Witnesses multiplied.&mdash;World's
End predicted.&mdash;To save credit,
Antichrist invented.</h3>


<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 1.</h4>

<h5>RESURRECTION-WITNESSES MULTIPLIED.</h5>

<p>After what has been seen of the seven days' course
of perjury, proofs of simple falsehood will be apt to
appear superfluous. To make certainty more sure,
two preeminent ones shall, however, be brought to
view. They may have their use, were it only as examples
of the palpableness, of those falsehoods,
which, for so many hundreds of years, and through
so many generations of commentators, are, under
favourable circumstances, capable of remaining undetected.
The extravagance of the addition, made
by the audacious stranger, to the number of the Resurrection-witnesses,
as given by themselves:&mdash;the
predicted end of the world in the prophet's own lifetime,&mdash;and
the creation of Antichrist for the purpose
of putting off that catastrophe,&mdash;may even be not altogether
unamusing, by the picture they will give, of
that mixture of rashness and craftiness, which constitutes
not the least remarkable, of the ingredients
in the composition of this extraordinary character.
Moreover, Antichrist being in the number of the bug-bears,
by the images of which many an enfeebled mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
has not yet ceased to be tormented;&mdash;putting an extinguisher
upon this hobgoblin may have the serious
good effect, of calming a mass of disquietude, which
how completely soever groundless, is not the less
afflicting, to the minds into which it has found entrance.</p>

<p>First, as to the resurrection-witnesses. In relation
to a fact of such cardinal importance, the accounts
which have reached us from the four biographers
of Jesus are not, it must be confessed, altogether
so clear as could have been wished. But, on so
ample a subject, howsoever tempting the occasion,
anything that could here be offered, with any promise
of usefulness, would occupy far too much space, and
be by much too wide a digression from the design
of the present work.<a name="FNanchor_63_69" id="FNanchor_63_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_69" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Sufficient to the present purpose will be the observation,
that nothing can be more palpably or irreconcileably
inconsistent with every one of them, than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
amply and round number, thus added by the effrontery
of this uninformed stranger, to the most ample
that can be deduced from any of the accounts, thus
stated as given by the only description of persons,
whose situation would give to their testimony the
character of the best evidence.</p>

<p>Behold now the account of the number and of the
persons in Paul's own words. It is in the fifteenth
chapter of the first of his two letters to his Corinthians.
"Moreover, brethren," ver. 1, "I declare unto
you the Gospel, the good news, which I <i>preached</i>
unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein
ye stand.&mdash;&mdash; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep
in memory what I preached unto you unless ye have
believed in vain.&mdash;&mdash;For I delivered unto you first
of all that which I also received, how that Christ
died for our sins, according to the Scriptures:&mdash;&mdash; And
that he was buried, and that he rose again the
third day, according to the Scriptures:&mdash;&mdash; And
that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:&mdash;&mdash; After
that, he was seen of <i>above five hundred brethren
at once</i>; of whom the greater part remain unto
this present, but some are fallen asleep.&mdash;&mdash; After
that he was seen of James, then of all the Apostles.&mdash;&mdash; And
last of all he was seen of me also, as of one
born out of due time.&mdash;&mdash;For I am the least of the
Apostles, which am not meet to be called as Apostle,
because I persecuted the church of God."<a name="FNanchor_64_70" id="FNanchor_64_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_70" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>As to the five hundred brethren at once, with the
additions <i>in petto</i>, the more closely the Gospel accounts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
are looked into, the more entire will be a
Man's conviction of the extravagance of this account.
In addition to the eleven Apostles that remained
after the death of the traitor Judas, it may be matter
of question, whether so much as a single individual
can be found, who, in any one of the Gospels, is
stated as having, after the death of Jesus, received
from the testimony of sense, the demonstration of
his presence. Of the percipient witnesses in question,
not to waste space and time in needless discussions,
taking a round number, and including both
sexes taken together, no number approaching to
twenty can be made out from any one of the four Gospel
accounts, nor from all of them taken together. To
what end then substitute, to less than twenty, more
than five hundred? To what, but to supply by falsehood
the deficiency left by truth. The thing to be
done was the coming up to the expectations, whatever
they might be, of his Corinthians. Number twenty,&mdash;said
he to himself,&mdash;may perhaps fall short: well
then, strike out the twenty, and set down five hundred.
Thus did the self-constituted Apostle take a
leaf out of the book of the unjust steward. Luke 16:1-20.</p>

<p>Now then as to mutually contradictory numbers&mdash;that
given by the four Evangelists, and that given by
this one stranger,&mdash;to which shall we give credence?
As to the Evangelists,&mdash;whether, in the situation in
which they were, and writing for the purposes for
which they wrote,&mdash;these most intimate of the associates
of the departed Jesus, and percipient witnesses
of the several facts in question,&mdash;all of them
spoken of in the same narration, all of them so fully
apprised of the whole real number&mdash;could have been
disposed, any one of them, to get down a number
<i>short</i> of the truth,&mdash;may be left to anyone to imagine.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>

<p>But, according to Paul's calculation, the truth would
not come up to his purpose:&mdash;to his particular purpose:
a number, such as could not fail of doing so,
was therefore to be substituted.</p>

<p><i>Five hundred</i> was as easily written as <i>twenty</i>. Had
Jerusalem, or any place in its neighbourhood, been
the place, to which this letter of his was to be addressed,
some caution might have been necessary.
But Corinth&mdash;a place so remote from the scene of
action&mdash;being the abode of the disciples, to whom this
letter of his was addressed,&mdash;and the letters themselves,
not destined to be seen by any other than devoted
eyes,&mdash;Invention found herself at ease.</p>

<p>Meantime, while Jesus was thus magnified, Paul
was not <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'be to'">to be</ins> forgotten. Insufficient still would be
the cloud of witnesses, unless himself were added to
it. "Last of all," says he, 1 Cor. 15:8, "he," Jesus,
"was seen of me also." Seen by him Paul? at what
place? at what time? At the time of his conversion,
when hearing a voice and seeing light, but nothing
else? But the whole constellation of his visions will
here be crowding to the reader's view, and any more
particular reference to them would be useless: suffice
it to observe, that on no other occasion, either does
Paul himself, or his historiographer for him, take
upon himself to say, that he had ever seen Jesus
any otherwise than in a <i>vision</i>, whatsoever may have
been meant by this so convenient term. On no occasion
is it so much as pretended, either by him or for
him, that <i>in the flesh</i> Jesus was ever seen by him. By
no fingers of his murder-abetting hand, had ever been
so much as pretended to have been probed, the
wounds of Jesus. Yet, what are the terms employed,
by him, in speaking of the <i>sight</i>, he pretended to have
had of Jesus? exactly the same, as those employed
by him, when speaking of the evidence, vouchsafed
to the Apostles.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 2.</h4>

<h5>FALSE PROPHECY,&mdash;THAT THE WORLD WOULD END IN THE
LIFETIME OF PERSONS THEN LIVING.</h5>

<p>The unsatiableness of Paul's ambition meets the eye
at every page: the fertility of his invention is no
less conspicuous. So long as, between this and the
other world, the grave stood interposed,&mdash;the strongest
impression capable of being made by pictures of
futurity, even when drawn by so bold a hand, was not
yet sufficient for stocking it with the power it grasped
at. This barrier, at whatever hazard, he accordingly
determined to remove. The future world being thus
brought at both ends into immediate contact with the
present,&mdash;the obedient, for whom the joys of heaven
were provided, would behold the troubles of <i>the middle
passage</i> saved to them, while the disobedient
would see the jaws of hell opened for their reception,
without any such halting-place, as might otherwise
seem to be offered by the grave. In particular, by a
nearer as well as smoother road than that rugged one,
he would make his way to heaven: nor would they,
whose obedience gave them a just claim to so high a
favour, be left behind.</p>

<p>His Thessalonians were the disciples, chosen by
him for the trial of this experiment. Addressed to
them we have two of his Epistles. In these curious
and instructive documents, the general purport&mdash;not
only of what had been said to the persons in question
on a former occasion, but likewise of the observation
of which on <i>their</i> part it had been productive,&mdash;is
rendered sufficiently manifest, by what we shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
find him saying in the first of them. "Good," said
they, "as to <i>some</i> of us, whoever they may be: but,
how is it to be with <i>the rest</i>? in particular, with
those who have actually died already: not to speak
of those others who will have been dying off in the
meantime: for you do not go so far as to promise,
that we shall, all of us, be so sure of escaping death
as you yourself are." "Make yourselves easy,"
we shall find him saying to them: "sooner or later,
take my word for it, we shall, all of us, mount up
together in a body: those who are dead, those who
are to die, and those who are not to die&mdash;all of us at
once, and by the same conveyance: up, in the air,
and through the clouds, we shall go. The Lord will
come down and meet us, and show us the way:&mdash;music,
vocal and instrumental, will come with him,
and a rare noise altogether there will be! Those who
died first will have risen first; what little differences
there may be are not worth thinking about.
Comfort yourselves," concludes he, "with these
words." Assuredly not easily could more comfortable
ones have been found:&mdash;always supposing them
followed by belief, as it appears they were. But it is
time we should see more particularly what they were.</p>

<p>1 Thess. 4:10 to 18.&mdash;"And indeed ye do it," viz.
love one another, ver. 9, "toward all the brethren
which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you,
brethren, that ye increase more and more;&mdash;And
that ye study to be <i>quiet</i>, and to do <i>your own business,
and to work with your own hands, as we commanded
you</i>;&mdash;That ye may walk honestly toward
them that are without, and that ye may have lack
of nothing.&mdash;But I would not have you to be ignorant,
brethren, concerning them which are <i>asleep</i>,
that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no
hope.&mdash;For if we believe that Jesus died and rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
again, even so <i>them also which sleep in Jesus will
God bring with him</i>.&mdash;For this we say unto you
by the word of the Lord, that <i>we which are alive
and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not
prevent them which are asleep</i>.&mdash;For the Lord
himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,
with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump
of God: and <i>the dead in Christ shall rise first.&mdash;Then
we which are alive and remain, shall be
caught up together with them in the clouds</i>, to meet
the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with
the Lord.&mdash;Wherefore comfort one another with
these words." Hereupon, without any intervening
matter, follows that of the next chapter. The division
into chapters,&mdash;though, for the purpose of reference,
not merely a useful, but an altogether necessary
one,&mdash;is universally acknowledged to have been
a comparatively modern one.</p>

<p>1 Thess. 5:1-11. "But <i>of the times and the seasons,
brethren, ye have no need that I write unto
you</i>.&mdash;For yourselves know perfectly, that <i>the
day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night</i>.&mdash;For
when they shall say, Peace and safety,
then <i>sudden destruction cometh upon them</i>, as travail
upon a woman with child; and they shall not
escape.&mdash;<i>But ye, brethren, are not in darkness</i>,
that that day should overtake you as a thief.&mdash;Ye
are all the children of light, and the children
of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.&mdash;Therefore
<i>let us not sleep, as do others; but let
us watch and be sober</i>.&mdash;For they that sleep, sleep
in the night; and they that be drunken, are drunken
in the night.&mdash;But let us, who are of the day,
be sober, putting on the breastplate of <i>faith</i> and
love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.&mdash;For
<i>God hath not appointed us to wrath</i>, but to obtain
salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ.&mdash;Who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we
should live together with him.&mdash;Wherefore <i>comfort
yourselves</i> together, and edify one another,
even as also ye do."</p>

<p>An ingenious game was the one thus played by
Paul, if ever there was one. Of this prophecy,<a name="FNanchor_65_71" id="FNanchor_65_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_71" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
what when once mentioned, is plainly enough visible,
is&mdash;this is of the number of those predictions, by
which profit is put in for, and no loss risked: for such
is the shape given to it. So long as the predictor
lived, it would remain good and undisfulfilled: at the
end of a certain time&mdash;namely, at the end of the life
of the longest liver of the aggregate number of individuals
in existence at that time,&mdash;the disfulfillment
would indeed take place. But if, by that time, the
predictor had made his exit,&mdash;as, in this case, being
already of a certain age, it is tolerably certain he
would,&mdash;the reproach of false prophecy would not
have reached him: and, even, supposing it to have
reached him, as it would do if he survived the last of
them, still the speculation would not be a very bad
one. His <i>prophecy</i>, his <i>purposes</i> would have been
fulfilled.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span></p>
<p>Not altogether without claim to observation, is the
manner, in which, by the adroitness of the soothsayer,
the anxiety of questioners is evaded. That he
himself does not know, nor ever expects to know,&mdash;that
is what his prudence forbids his telling them.
"The day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the
night:" this is what, in answer to former importunities,
he had at <i>that</i> time told them. "For you
yourselves," says he, "know this perfectly;" that is,
in so far as they could know from <i>his telling</i>: this
being, in this instance, the only source,&mdash;of that <i>delusion</i>,
to which he gave the name of <i>knowledge</i>. This
he had told them <i>then</i>: and more, he takes care not
to tell them <i>now</i>. "Of the times and seasons, brethren,"
says he, "ye have no need that I write unto
you." Meantime, their hopes and fears, and therewith
their dependence upon his good pleasure, are
kept still alive: in the first place, the hope&mdash;that,
knowing already more than he as yet desires to disclose,
he may by ulterior obsequiousness be prevailed
upon to disclose it: in the next place, the hope&mdash;that,
though not as yet possessed of the information, he
may at some future period be able to obtain it, and
in that case give them the benefit of it.</p>

<p>To a speculation of this sort,&mdash;in how particular a
degree favourable the mode of communication by letter
was, is sufficiently visible. Writing, was an operation
not quite so prompt, in those days as in these.
Between Thessalonica and Athens,&mdash;from whence, as
they tell us, these Epistles were written,&mdash;there was
not, it may be affirmed without much danger of error,
any established letter-post: and, even if there was,&mdash;to
this or that question, which a man sees in a letter,
he makes or does not make answer, as he finds convenient.
Not exactly so, when the questioner is at his
elbow.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 3.</h4>

<h5>DISORDER AND MISCHIEF PRODUCED BY THIS PREDICTION.</h5>

<p>We have seen the prophecy: let us now see the effects
of it. They were such as might have been expected.
They were such as had been expected: expected, as
may have been observed, at a very early period. But
there was rather <i>more</i> in them than had been expected.</p>

<p>Of the confusion, which, by an expectation of this
sort, in a state of society, so much inferior, in the
scale of moral conduct, to any, of which in this our
age and country we have experience, was capable of
being produced,&mdash;it can scarcely, at this time of day,
be in any man's power, to frame to himself anything
approaching to an adequate conception. So far as regards
peaceable idleness, of the general nature of it,
some faint conception may under modern manners be
formed, from the accounts of the effects produced by
a similar prediction, delivered first in France, then in
England, about the time of Queen Anne:&mdash;so far as
regards a mixture of idleness and positive mischief
in a time of terror, under ancient manners,&mdash;from
the accounts, given by Thucydides, of the effects produced
at Athens, by the near approach of death, on
the occasion of the plague;&mdash;and, from that given by
Josephus, of the effects produced by the like cause,
on the occasion of the siege, which, under his eye, terminated
in the final destruction of Jerusalem by the
Romans.</p>

<p>According to each man's cast of mind, and the
colour of the expectations that had been imbibed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
it,&mdash;terror and self-mortification, or confidence and
mischievous self-indulgence, would be the natural
result: terror and self-mortification, if apprehensions
grounded on the retrospect of past misconduct predominated&mdash;mischievous
indulgence, if, by the alleged
or supposed all-sufficiency of faith,&mdash;of faith,
of which the preacher was the object&mdash;the importance
of morality had, even in the imagination of the disciple,
been thrown into the back-ground: confabulation
without end, in the case of terror; cessation from
work, in both cases.</p>

<p>Had he been somewhat less positive on the head of
<i>time</i>,&mdash;the purposes of those announcements of his
might have been completely, and without any deduction,
fulfilled. The terror he infused could not be unfavourable
to those purposes, so long as it made no
deduction, from the value of the produce of their industry!
It was his interest, that they should "<i>walk
honestly</i>," lest they should be punished for walking
otherwise:&mdash;punished, capitally or not capitally&mdash;and,
in either case, bring his teaching into disgrace. It
was his interest, that they should <i>work</i>, in such sort,
as to earn each of them the expense of his maintenance;
lest, by abstaining from work, they should,
any one of them, impose a burthen upon the charity of
the others, or be seen to walk dishonestly, to the prejudice
of the common cause, as above. It was his interest,
that they should, each of them, gain as much
as could be gained without reproach or danger; because,
the greater the surplus produced by each disciple,
the greater the tribute, that could be paid to
the spiritual master, under whose command they had
put themselves. Thus far his interest and theirs were
in agreement. But, it was his interest, that, while
working to these ends, their minds, at the expense of
whatever torment to themselves, should be kept in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
state of constant ferment, between the passions of
hope and fear; because, the stronger the influence of
the two allied passions in their breasts, the more
abundant would be the contributions, of which, to the
extent of each man's ability, they might reasonably
be expected to be productive. Here it was, that his
interest acted in a direction opposite to theirs: and
it was by too ardent a pursuit of this his separate
interest, that so much injury, as we shall see, was
done to all those other interests.</p>

<p>Of the disease which we shall see described, the
description, such as it is, is presented, by the matter
furnished by the practitioner himself, by whose prescription
the disease was produced. This matter we
must be content to take, in that state of disorder,
which constitutes one of the most striking features of
the issue of his brain. In speaking of the symptoms,&mdash;addressed
as his discourse is to nobody but the patients
themselves by whom these symptoms had been
experienced,&mdash;only in the way of allusion, and thence
in very general terms, could they naturally have been,
as they will actually be seen to be, presented to view.
As to details,&mdash;from them to him, not from him to
them, was, it will readily be acknowledged, the only
natural course.</p>

<p>In the same Epistle,&mdash;namely in the second, which
is the last, but, in a passage which does not come till
after the announcement, which, as will be seen under
the next head, was to operate as a remedy,&mdash;stands
the principal part of the matter from whence we have
been enabled to collect the nature of the disease. The
chapter is the third and concluding one:&mdash;the words
that add nothing to the information, are here and
there omitted.</p>

<p>1. "Finally, brethren, pray for us ...&mdash;that we
may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
men; for all men have not faith.&mdash;And we have confidence
in the Lord touching you, that ye both do
and will do the things which we <i>command</i> you.&mdash;And
the Lord direct your hearts ... into the <i>patient
waiting for Christ</i>.&mdash;Now we <i>command</i> you, brethren ...
that ye <i>withdraw yourselves from every
brother that walketh disorderly</i>, and not after the
tradition which he received of us.&mdash;For yourselves
know how ye ought to follow <i>us</i>: for we <i>behaved not
ourselves disorderly among you:&mdash;Neither did we
eat any man's bread for nought</i>: but wrought with
labour and travail night and day, that we might
not be chargeable to any of you.&mdash;<i>Not because we
have not power</i>, but to make ourselves an example
unto you to follow us.&mdash;for <i>even when we were with
you</i>, this we <i>commanded</i> you, that <i>if any would not
work, neither should he eat</i>.&mdash;For we hear that
<i>there are some which walk among you disorderly,
working not at all, but are busybodies</i>.&mdash;Now them
that are such, <i>we command</i> and exhort by our Lord
Jesus Christ, <i>that with quietness they work, and eat
their own bread</i>.&mdash;But ye brethren, <i>be not
weary in well-doing</i>.&mdash;And if any man obey not our
word by this Epistle, note that man, and have no
company with him, that he may be ashamed."</p>

<p>By anything we have as yet seen, the symptoms of
the disease, it may be thought, are not painted in any
very strong colours. But, of the virulence of it there
is no want of evidence. It may be seen, in the drastic
nature of the remedy:&mdash;a remedy, for the invention
of which, we shall, in the next section, see the ingenuity
of the practitioner put to so extraordinary a
stretch.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 4.</h4>

<h5>PAUL'S REMEDY FOR THE DISORDER, AND SALVO FOR HIMSELF.&mdash;ANTICHRIST
MUST FIRST COME.</h5>

<p>We have seen the disorder: we had before that seen
the causes of it. We now come to the remedy&mdash;the
remedy provided by the practitioner for a disease of
his own creating. Of the shape given to this remedy,
the ingenuity will be seen to be truly worthy of the
author of the disease. It consists in the announcement
made, of an intermediate state of things, of the
commencement of which, any more than of the termination,
nothing is said: except that it was to take
place, antecedently to that originally announced state
of things, by the expectation of which the disorder
had been produced. Of the <i>time</i> of its commencement,
no: except as above, on that point no information
is given. But of its <i>duration</i>, though no determinate
information, yet such a description is given,
as suffices for giving his disciples to understand, that
in the nature of things, it could not be a short one:
and that thus, before the <i>principal</i> state of things
took place, there would be a proportionate quantity
of time for <i>preparation</i>. Satisfied of this, they would
see the necessity of conforming themselves to those
reiterated "<i>commands</i>," with which his prediction
had from the first been accomplished; and to which
he had so erroneously trusted, when he regarded
them as composing a sufficient antidote to the poison
he had infused. That the warning thus provided for
them would be a very short one, he left them, it will
be seen, no great reason to apprehend. A sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
spiritual monster,&mdash;a sort of an ape of <i>Satan</i>, a rival
to the Almighty,&mdash;and <i>that</i> by no means a contemptible
one&mdash;was to enter upon the stage.</p>

<p>What with force and what with fraud, such would
be his power,&mdash;that the fate of the Almighty would
have appeared too precarious, had not the spirits of
his partisans been kept up, by the assurance, that
when all was over, the Almighty would remain master
of the field.</p>

<p>The time, originally fixed, by him for the aerial
voyage, was too <i>near</i>. By the hourly expectation of
it, had been produced all those disastrous effects
which had ensued. After what had been said, an
<i>adjournment</i> presented the only possible remedy.
But this adjournment, after what had been said, by
what imaginable means could it be produced? One
only means was left by the nature of the case.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>2 Thess. 2:1-12. "Now we beseech you, brethren,
by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our
gathering together unto him,&mdash;That ye <i>be not</i> soon
shaken in mind, or be <i>troubled</i>, neither by spirit,
nor by word, nor <i>by letter as from us,<a name="FNanchor_66_72" id="FNanchor_66_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_72" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> as that

<p>To this rival of his God&mdash;God and rival&mdash;both of
them of his own creation, the creator has not, we see,
given any name. By this omission, he has, perhaps,
as perhaps he thought to do, rendered the bugbear
but the more terrible. The deficiency, such as it is,
the Church of England translators of the English
official translation of the Bible, have filled up: they
have taken it in hand&mdash;this bantling of Paul's&mdash;and
christened it <i>Antichrist</i>. "He," Paul, "showeth,"
say they, "a discovery of <i>Antichrist</i>, before the day
of the Lord come." Such is the discovery, communicated
in the <i>heading</i>, prefixed to the second
chapter of the second of the two Epistles: and, of
the readers of this so abundantly and gratuitously
distributed Bible, how few are there, by whom any
such distinction as that between the headings and
the text is borne in mind! The right reverend divines
in question,&mdash;were they the first authors of this discovery,
or was it ready-made to their hands?&mdash;made
by that church, from the errors of which their own
has been so felicitously purified? To this question,
let those look out for, and find, the answer,&mdash;in whose
eyes the profit is worth the trouble.</p>

<p>Not a few are the divines, who have discovered
Antichrist sitting in St. Peter's chair, with a triple
crown on his head. In the chair of Luther, or in that
of Calvin, would the triple monarch be disposed to
discover the hobgoblin, if he thought it worth while
to look for him. Has he ever, or has he not, made
this discovery already?</p>

<p>"Oh, but," says somebody, "<i>we</i> does not here
mean <i>we</i> only who are alive at this present writing;
it means, <i>we</i> Christians of all ages:&mdash;any number
of ages <i>after</i> this, as well as this, included. In the
designation thus given, neither the individuals he
was addressing, nor he himself, were necessarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
comprehended." This accordingly, if anything,
must be said, or the title of the self-constituted
Apostle, to the appellation of <i>false prophet</i>, must
be admitted. Oh, yes! this may be said, and must
be said: but what will it avail him? In no such comprehensive
sense did <i>he</i> use it; for, in that sense, it
would not have answered his purposes: not even his
spiritual and declared purposes, much less his temporal,
selfish, and concealed purposes. Why was it
that these disciples of his, as well as he, were to be
so incessantly upon the watch! I Thess. 5:6, 7, 8.
Why, but because "you yourselves," says he, ver. 2,
"know perfectly, that the day of the Lord cometh
like a thief in the night." Who, on that occasion,
could be meant by <i>we</i>, but himself and them? In no
such comprehensive sense was it understood by <i>them</i>:
if it had been, no such consequences as we have seen
following, could have followed. After the experience
he and they had had, of the mischief produced by
the narrow sense put upon the all-important pronoun,
would he have continued thus to use it in that same
narrow sense, if it had not been his wish that in that
same sense it should continue to be understood?
Would he have been at all this pains in creating the
spiritual monster, for the declared purpose of putting
off their expectation of the great day, if, but for
this put-off, it would not have come on?<a name="FNanchor_75_81" id="FNanchor_75_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_81" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> In what
part of all his preachings can any distinct ground
be seen for any such supposition, as that any portion
of the field of <i>time</i>, beyond that by which his own life
was bounded, was ever present to his view? In the
field of <i>place</i>, yes: in that field his views were of no
small amplitude: for in that field it was by his ambition
that they were marked out: but in the field of
<i>time</i>, no symptoms of any the smallest degree of
enlargement will anywhere be found. But, on this
occasion, suppose other ages, and those others to any
extent, included in his views: from their including
such future ages, would it follow that they had no
application to the age then present?&mdash;But, supposing
them understood to apply to that age, thereupon in
comes the mischief in full force.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span></p>
<p>Any man that has been reading these Epistles,&mdash;let
him suppose, in his own breast, any the most
anxious desire to raise an expectation, such as that
in question: and then let him ask himself, whether it
be in the power of that desire to suggest language,
that would afford any considerably better promise
of giving effect to it.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the <i>nature</i> of the <i>disorder</i>, as well as of the
cause of it,&mdash;the persons, to whom the world is indebted
for the preservation of these remains of the
self-constituted Apostle,&mdash;have given us, as above,
some conception. Of the <i>effect</i> of the <i>remedy</i>, it
would have been amusing to be informed: unfortunately,
this portion of his history is not comprised
in the labours of his historiographer.<a name="FNanchor_76_82" id="FNanchor_76_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_82" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_63_69" id="Footnote_63_69"></a><a href="#FNanchor_63_69"><span class="label">[63]</span></a> The account given by Luke of the resurrection and ascension of
Jesus is contained in the last chapter, chap. 24:53. According to
this account, by no men was Jesus seen in the interval between those
two events, besides the eleven Apostles and a few others, all together
not more than enough, to sit down together at meat, in one of the
houses of a village. Luke 25:9, 28, 29, 30. Number of the occasions
on which Jesus was seen by the Apostles, two: the company
the same without addition, and both occasions having place within
twenty-four hours. Between these two occasions it is that Paul
sticks in the one of his own invention, in which Jesus was seen by
above five hundred brethren at once.
</p>
<p>
Point-blank on this head is the contradiction given to this story
of Paul's, by his own attendant and historiographer: namely, in
the account put into the mouth of Peter, speaking to Centurion
Cornelius, Acts 10:39 to 42. Expressly is it there said, ver. 40,
"Him" (Jesus) "God raised up the third day, and showed him
openly;&mdash;Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before
of God even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose
from the dead." When in the year 62, or some posterior year, the
author of the Acts was writing his history, nothing, it will be
inferred, did he know of the contradictory account given by his
hero, in writing in a letter written in the year 57.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_64_70" id="Footnote_64_70"></a><a href="#FNanchor_64_70"><span class="label">[64]</span></a> Follows a sample of Paul's logic wrapped up as usual in a
cloud of tautologies and paralogisms, the substance of which amounts
to this:&mdash;Jesus resurrects; therefore all men will do the same.
Admitting the legitimacy of this induction, what will be the thing
proved? That every man, a few days after his death, will come to
life again, and eat, drink, and walk in company with his friends.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_65_71" id="Footnote_65_71"></a><a href="#FNanchor_65_71"><span class="label">[65]</span></a> By the word <i>prophecy</i> the idea meant to be conveyed in Jewish
language seems to be very generally misconceived. It is regarded
as exactly synonymous to <i>prediction</i>. Nothing can be more erroneous.
In New Testament language in particular, it is no less
applicable to past events than to future. Witness, "Prophecy who
is it that smote thee." Luke 17:64. In the Greek, the word is
occasion, it meant evidently neither more nor less than <i>speak out</i>.
Hence it came to signify speaking in public: hence again, speaking
as a statesman: hence again, writing as a statesman, as well as
speaking. Not that a statesman could ever or can ever be a
statesman, and in the above sense, <i>a prophet</i>, without being a
<i>predictor</i> likewise: as often as any proposed measure is on the carpet,
such he must be, or what he says must be nothing to the purpose.
Merely by uttering a prediction concerning future events,
Paul would not have included, in his prophecy, any such pretension,
as that of a supernatural communication received from the Almighty:
but, the one here in question was one which, supposing it true, could
not have come from any other source.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_66_72" id="Footnote_66_72"></a><a href="#FNanchor_66_72"><span class="label">[66]</span></a> Here we have a sort of retractation. This shows how he was

and so bent on punishing it,&mdash;have they ever found so clear a case
as this which is before us? Would not they have begun at the
more proper end, had they begun with the editors of these Epistles?</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_74_80" id="Footnote_74_80"></a><a href="#FNanchor_74_80"><span class="label">[74]</span></a> For this damnation,&mdash;on the present as on so many other
occasions, those who are so eager to believe, that all who differ
from them on a question of evidence, will be consigned to everlasting
torments, are indebted to the right reverend translators: the original
says <i>condemned</i>. This may be understood to mean&mdash;<i>damned</i> in the
ordinary sense of the word <i>damned</i>, or whatever less unpleasant
result may be more agreeable.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_75_81" id="Footnote_75_81"></a><a href="#FNanchor_75_81"><span class="label">[75]</span></a> Of this child of the self-appointed Apostle's brain, it seems
not altogether improbable, that, in case of need, some further use
was in contemplation to be made: with the skin of this bugbear,
might, upon occasion, be invested, any person, to whom, either in
the character of a declared <i>adversary</i>, or in that of a <i>rival</i>, it might
happen, to have become in a certain degree troublesome: a <i>declared
adversary</i>,&mdash;that is, either a Gentile or an unbelieving Jew: <i>a rival</i>,&mdash;that
is, one who, believing in the religion of Jesus, adhered to that
edition of it, which had the Apostles of Jesus for its publishers, or
followed any other edition which was not <i>his</i>: one of those, for
example, upon whom we have seen him making such bitter war in
his Epistle to his Galatians. Of the two, the believing rival would
of course be much more troublesome, than the non-believing adversary,
from whom, if let alone, he would not experience an annoyance.
Of this rival class were they whose "<i>unrighteousness</i>," 2 Thess. 2:10,
had recourse to "<i>deceivableness</i>:" for as to non-believers, no need
could they have of <i>deceivableness</i>; to foil him, they had but to turn
aside from him, and stand as they were. Those men, whose unrighteousness
had recourse to deceivableness, who could they be,
but the men of the same description in this respect as those, whom
in chapter third of his Epistle to his Galatians, he complains of as
having "bewitched" them; and <i>that</i> in such sort, as to have made
him so far lose his temper as to call them "<i>foolish</i>:" and that <i>they</i>
were rivals, is a matter altogether out of doubt. In a word, rivals
were the only troublesome sort of men, who, at the writing of this
Epistle, could, with the nameless monster since named <i>Antichrist</i>,
be yet to come.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_76_82" id="Footnote_76_82"></a><a href="#FNanchor_76_82"><span class="label">[76]</span></a> As for that "<i>helmet of faith</i>," which, in the passage first
quoted, he has been seen commanding his disciples to put on&mdash;of
that faith, which is the everlasting object of his so indefatigably
repeated "<i>command</i>," and which is always faith in <i>Paul</i>,&mdash;for of
Jesus scarcely is so much as a word, except the name, to be found
in any of his Epistles,&mdash;as to this helmet, it is the sort of cap,
which a man learned how to put on, when he had made himself
perfect, in what may be called the <i>self-deceptive exercise</i>, or in a
word <i>the exercise of faith</i>. It is composed of two very simple
operations: at the word of command, the recruit turns its face <i>to</i>
the arguments on one side; at the word of command, it turns its
back to those on the other side. The test of perfection is&mdash;its being
able to hold in its embrace, for any length of time, both parts
together of a self-contradictory proposition; such as, that three
<i>man's-persons</i>,&mdash;to use the German word, or if any <i>other sorts of
persons</i> there are three others,&mdash;are but one. When the helmet sits
close enough on his head to enable him to do this, there is no fear
of its falling off. Holding fast to improbabilities, how absurd and
extravagant soever, is thenceforward but child's play to him:&mdash;for
example, belief in the future existence of Paul's Antichrist:
including, the coming on of those scenes, in which that <i>raw-head
and bloody bones</i> is to be the principal performer.
</p>
<p>
To this, as to anything else, the mind of man is capable of
being brought, by assurances of infinite enjoyment, in case of his
having made himself perfect in this exercise, or of infinite torment
in case of his neglecting it: of course, still more effectually, by
both assurances put together; and, considering the facility of both
operations, easier terms could not very easily be imagined. A
capital convenience is&mdash;that, for producing faith in this way, not a
particle of anything in the shape of evidence is necessary: the
place of evidence is supplied by assurance:&mdash;by the intensity, real
or apparent, of the persuasion, to which expression has been given,
by what the preacher has said or done. The more intense the
apparent assurance on the one part, the greater the apparent <i>safety</i>,
obtained by yielding to it, on the other: and thus it is, that no
absurdity can be so flagrant, that the side on which it is found may
not be embraced, under the notion of its being the <i>safe</i> side. When
Paul, with his accustomed vehemence, was preaching the world's
end, so many of his Thessalonians as believed in it, believed, that
believing in it was being on the safe side. On the part of the
preacher, the more vehement and impudent the assurance, the
greater on the part of the disciple, the apparent <i>danger</i> on the
disbelieving, the apparent <i>safety</i> on the believing side.
</p>
<p>
By this means are produced the signs and wonders we read of
in the Epistles of our modern missionaries; for, how conclusive
soever the evidence may be, which the assertions they employ
might call in for their support,&mdash;conclusive to every reasonable mind
by which it was received,&mdash;assuredly it is not by the evidence, but
by the unsupported assertion, that, on the occasion of those exploits
of theirs,&mdash;whatever credence has place, is produced.</p></div></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3><i>Paul's supposable Miracles explained.</i></h3>


<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 1.</h4>

<h5>OBJECTIONS, APPLYING TO THEM IN THE AGGREGATE.</h5>

<p>But, it may be said, Paul's alleged commission from
God was certainly genuine; for it is proved by his
miracles. Look at the Acts, no fewer than twelve
miracles of his you will find. If then taken by themselves,
for want of that accurate conception of the
probative form of evidence, to which maturer ages
have given birth, the account of the miracle by which
his conversion was wrought fails of being completely
satisfactory,&mdash;look at his miracles, the deficiency will
be filled up. The man, to whom God had imparted
such extraordinary powers&mdash;powers so completely
matchless in these our times,&mdash;can such a man have
been a liar&mdash;an impostor? a liar for the purpose of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
deceit&mdash;of giving support to a system of deception&mdash;and
that a lucrative one? An imposition so persevering
as to have been carried on, from youth to
death, through, perhaps, the greatest part of his
life?</p>

<p>The observation is plausible:&mdash;the answer will not
be the less satisfactory.</p>

<p>The answer has two branches: one, <i>general</i>, applying
to all the alleged miracles in question, taken
in the lump: the other <i>particular</i>, applying to the
several miracles separately considered.</p>

<p>Observations applying to the whole together are,
the following:</p>

<p>1. Not by Paul himself, in any one of his own
Epistles, is any such general assertion made, as that
he had received from God or from Jesus,&mdash;or, in a
word, that he was in possession of, any such power,
as the power of working miracles.</p>

<p>2. Nowhere in the account given of his transactions
by the author of the Acts, is he in any of his speeches
represented as making reference to any one act of his
in the character of a miracle.</p>

<p>3. Nowhere in that same account, is he represented
as stating himself to be in possession of any
such powers.</p>

<p>4. Not by the author of the Acts, is he spoken of
as being in possession of any such power.</p>

<p>5. Nowhere by the author of the Acts, is he in
any general terms spoken of, as producing any effects,
such as, in respect of the power necessary to
the production of them, approach to those spoken of
as having been produced by Simon Magus; by that
declared impostor, in whose instance, no such commission
from God is represented as having been
received.</p>

<p>6. Neither on the occasion of his conversion, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
on any other occasion, is Paul stated to have received
from Jesus any such power as that of working
miracles:&mdash;any such power as the real Apostles
are&mdash;in Mark 16:15, 16, 17, 18&mdash;stated to have received
from Jesus.</p>

<p>Was it that, in his own conception, for gaining
credence to his pretension of a commission from
Jesus&mdash;from Jesus, styled by him the Lord Jesus&mdash;any
need of miracles, or of a persuasion, on the part
of those with whom he had to deal, of <i>his</i> having
power to work miracles? By no means. Of the
negative, the story told by him of the manner of
his conversion is abundant proof. Of the efficient
cause of this change in his mind, the account given,
is plainly given in the character of the account of a
miracle. But of this miracle, the proof given consists
solely in his own evidence: his own statement, unsupported
by that of any other person, or by reference
to that of any other person: his account, of the discourse,
which on the occasion of the vision, in which
nothing was seen but a flood of light, he heard from
the Lord Jesus: his own account, of the vision, which
he says was seen by Ananias: his own account, of
that other vision, which, according to Ananias, he,
Paul, had had, but of which Paul himself says nothing.</p>

<p>In the work of his adherent and sole biographer,
the author of <i>the Acts</i>,&mdash;we have five speeches, made
by him, in vindication of his conduct, in the character
of a preacher of the religion of Jesus; and, from his
own hand, Epistles out of number: yet nowhere is
any reference made, to so much as a single miracle
wrought by his own hand, unless the trance which
he falls into when he is alone, and the vision which
he sees, when nobody else sees anything, are to be
placed to the account of miracles. Miracles? <i>On</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
him, yes; <i>by</i> him, no. True it is, that, on one occasion,
he speaks in general terms of "signs and
wonders," as having been wrought by him. But
vague, in the highest degree, is the import, as well
as wide the extent, of those general terms: nor is it
by any means clear, that, even by himself, any such
claim was meant to be brought forward, as that of
having exhibited any such manifestations of supernatural
power, as are commonly regarded as designated
by the word <i>miracles</i>. In the multitude of the
persons, whom, in places so widely distant from one
another, he succeeded in numbering in the list of his
followers&mdash;in the depth of the impression, supposed
to have been made on the heart of this or that one
of them&mdash;in all or any one of these circumstances,
it was natural he should himself behold, and, whether
he did or no, use his endeavours to cause others to
behold, not only so many sources of wonder, but so
many circumstances; all conspiring to increase the
quantity of that confidence, which, with so much industry,
and, as far as appears, with such brilliant
success, he was labouring to plant in every breast:
circumstances, serving, in the minds of his adherents
in general, in the character of a sign or proof, of the
legitimacy of his pretension, as above.</p>

<p>But, of any such supernatural power as that which
is here in question, could any such loose and vague
expressions be reasonably regarded as affording any
sort of proof? No:&mdash;unless whatsoever, in the affairs
of men, can justly be regarded as <i>wonderful</i>,
ought also to be regarded as a miracle.</p>

<p>In one passage, and one alone, either in the Acts
or in his own Epistles, is he found laying any claim,
how distant and vague soever, to any such power, as
having ever been exercised by him. And, in this
instance, no one individual incident being in any way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
brought to view or referred to, what is said will be
seen to amount absolutely to nothing, being nothing
more than, without incurring any such interpretation
as that of imposture, is at the present time continually
averred by Christians of different sects.</p>

<p>He who makes so much of his <i>sufferings</i>, had he
wrought any miracles, would he have made nothing
of his <i>miracles</i>?</p>

<p>In the next place, although it must be admitted,
that, on several occasions, by his sole biographer and
professed adherent, viz., the author of the Acts, a
sort of colour of the marvellous seems endeavoured
to be laid on; laid on over the incident itself, and
over the part, which on that occasion was taken by
him; yet on no one of these occasions, unless perhaps
it be the last&mdash;of which presently,&mdash;does the account,
given by him of what passed, wear any such complexion
as shall render it matter of necessity, either
to regard it as miraculous, or to regard the biographer,

<h5>SUPPOSABLE MIRACLE I.&mdash;ELYMAS THE SORCERER
BLINDED.&mdash;<i>Acts</i> 13:6 to 12.</h5>

<p>1. Of these supposable miracles, the first that occurs
is that which had for its subject Elymas the
sorcerer.</p>

<p>At Paphos, in the island of Cyprus,<a name="FNanchor_77_83" id="FNanchor_77_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_83" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Paul and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
his associate Barnabas are sent for, by "the deputy
of the country," Sergius Paulus, who desires to
hear the word of God. But at that same place is a
certain Jew, of the name of Barjesus, alias Elymas,&mdash;a
sorcerer by profession, who "withstood them,
seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith."
To this man, it is not said, either where or when,
Paul is thereupon represented as making a short
speech, at the end of which, after calling him a child
of the devil, and so forth; he says to him, "<i>Thou
shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season</i>.
Thereupon," continues the story, "immediately
there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he
went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.
Then the deputy," it concludes, "when he saw
what was done, believed, being astonished at the
doctrine of the Lord."</p>

<p>Supposing this story to have had any foundation
in fact,&mdash;of the appearance of blindness thus exhibited,
where shall we look for the cause? In a
suspension of the laws of nature, performed by the
author of nature, to no other assignable end, than the
conversion of this Roman governor? At no greater
expense, than that of a speech from this same Paul,
the conversion of a king,&mdash;King Agrippa&mdash;if the
author of the Acts is to be believed, was nearly effected.
"Almost," says Agrippa, "thou hast persuaded
me to become a Christian." So often as
God is represented, as operating in a direct&mdash;however
secret and mysterious&mdash;manner, upon the heart,
<i>i.e.</i>, the mind, of this and that man,&mdash;while the
accounts given of the suspension of the laws of
nature are comparatively so few&mdash;to speak in that
sort of human language, in which alone the nature
of the case admits of our speaking, if the expense
of a miracle were not grudged,&mdash;might not, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
way above mentioned, by a much less lavish use of
supernatural power, the same effect have been produced?
viz., by a slight influence, exercised on the
heart of governor Paulus?</p>

<p>Whatsoever may have been the real state of the
case,&mdash;thus much seems pretty clear, viz., that at
this time of day, to a person whose judgment on
the subject should have, for its ground, the nature
of the human mind as manifested by experience,&mdash;another
mode of accounting for the appearance in
question will be apt to present itself as much more
probable. That is&mdash;that, by an understanding between
Paul and Elymas&mdash;between the ex-persecutor
and the sorcerer&mdash;the sorcerer, in the view of all
persons, in whose instance it was material that credence
should be given to the supposed miracle,&mdash;for
and during "<i>the season</i>" that was thought requisite,
kept his eyes shut.</p>

<p>The sorcerer was a Jew:&mdash;Paul was also a Jew.
Between them here was already one indissoluble
bond of connection and channel of intercourse. Elymas,
by trade a sorcerer, <i>i.e.</i>, an impostor&mdash;a person
of the same trade with Simon Magus, by whom so
conspicuous a figure is cut in the chapter of this
history&mdash;was a sort of person, who, on the supposition
of an adequate motive, could not naturally feel
any greater repugnance, at the idea of practicing
imposition, at so easy a rate as that of keeping his
eyes shut, than at the idea of practicing it, in any
of the shapes to which he had been accustomed:&mdash;shapes,
requiring more dexterity, and some, by which
he would be more or less exposed, to that detection,
from which, in the mode here in question, it would be
altogether secure.</p>

<p>But Paul&mdash;was he in a condition to render it worth
the sorcerer's while to give this shape to his imposture?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
Who can say that he was not? Yes: if to a
certain degree he had it in his power, either to benefit
him or to make him suffer? And who can say but
that these two means of operating, were one or other,
or both of them, in his power? As to the sorcerer's
betraying him, this is what he could not have done,
without betraying himself.</p>

<p>True it is, that, by acting this under part,&mdash;this
self-humiliating part,&mdash;so long as Paul stayed, so
long was the sorcerer, not the first, but only the second
wonder-worker of the town. But no sooner did
Paul's departure take place, than Elymas, from being
the second, became again the first.</p>

<h4>SECTION 3.</h4>

<h5>SUPPOSABLE MIRACLE II.&mdash;AT LYSTRA, CRIPPLE
CURED.&mdash;<i>Acts</i> 14:8 to 11.</h5>

<p>Second of these supposed miracles,&mdash;cure of the
cripple at Lystra.</p>

<p>This miracle makes a bad match with the before-mentioned
one.</p>

<p>Seeing a man at Lystra, neither man's name, nor
place's, except in that general way, nor time, in any
way mentioned,&mdash;seeing a man in the guise of a cripple,
"<i>Stand upright on thy feet</i>," says Paul to him
with a loud voice. "And," continues the story, "he
leaped and walked, steadfastly beholding and perceiving
that he had faith to be healed." Chorus of
the people thereupon, "The Gods are come down to
us in the likeness of men."</p>

<p>To the production of an appearance of this sort,
what was necessary? a real miracle? No, surely:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
so long as a vagrant was to be found, who, without
any risk, could act a part of this sort for a few pence,
in an age so fertile in imposture.</p>

<p>True it is, that this same man, whoever he was, is
represented as being "impotent in his feet, being a
cripple from his mother's womb, who never had
walked." But these words, how much more than
any other words, of the same length, in the same
number, did the writing of them cost the author of
this story? As to the correctness of his narratives,&mdash;of
the self-contradictory accounts given by him of
Paul's conversion, a sample has been already given.
As to detection, supposing this circumstance false,&mdash;detection
is what the account thus given of it renders
impossible. For&mdash;this same cripple, what was his
name? from birth to this time, where had he been
living? Of this nothing is said. That, at Lystra,
or anywhere else, the account was ever made public,
is neither affirmed, nor so much as insinuated: not
but that it might have been published, and, at the
same time, though as to everything but the scene
that exhibited itself to outward appearance, false,&mdash;might
not have found any person, at the same time
able and willing to contradict the falsity, and thus
naturalize the miracle.</p>

<h4>SECTION 4.</h4>

<h5>SUPPOSABLE MIRACLE III.&mdash;DIVINERESS SILENCED.&mdash;<i>Acts</i>
16:16-18.</h5>

<p>While Paul and his suite,&mdash;of whom, according to
the author of the Acts, he himself was one,&mdash;were at
Philippi,&mdash;a Roman colony, and capital of a part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
of Macedonia,&mdash;among their hearers, is Lydia&mdash;a
purple-seller of the City of Thyatira. Being converted,
she receives the whole party into her house.</p>

<p>From this house, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'in'">on</ins> their way to prayers,&mdash;probably
in a Jewish synagogue,&mdash;they are met by a
certain damsel, as nameless as the lame-born cripple,
who, being possessed of a spirit of divination, or of
Python, brings to her masters, for masters it seems
she had more than one, much gain by soothsaying.
Here then is a female, who, by being possessed by
or with a spirit,&mdash;a real spirit, whether devil or a
spirit of any other sort,&mdash;is converted into a prophetess,
and, doubtless, in the main a false prophetess.</p>

<p>In the present instance, however, she is a true
prophetess: for, following Paul and his suite, she
runs after them, saying, "These men are the servants
of the Most High God, which show unto us the way
of salvation. And this did she many days."</p>

<p>If, instead of a demon, it had been an angel, that
took her vocal organs for the instrument of his communications,
it is difficult to say, in what manner he
could have deserved better at the hands of these
"servants," real or pretended, "of the Most High
God."</p>

<p>Yet, from some cause or other that does not appear,
so it was it seems,&mdash;there was something about
her with which Paul was not well pleased. "Being
grieved, he turns and says,"&mdash;not to the damsel
herself, but to the spirit, which <i>possessed her</i>, or
rather, since for the benefit of her masters, it brought
her so much gain, which <i>she possessed</i>,&mdash;"I command
thee, in the name of Jesus Christ, to come
out of her."</p>

<p>Amongst the superstitions of that and other ages,
one was&mdash;the notion of a property, possessed by such
and such words&mdash;possessed, by these mere evanescent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
sounds&mdash;by the air of the atmosphere, when
made to vibrate in a certain manner:&mdash;a property,
of working effects in endless abundance and variety,
and those, too, supernatural ones. In some instances,
the wonders would be wrought by the words themselves,
whatsoever were the mouths by which they
were uttered. In other instances, they required, for
the production of the effects, a person, who being
possessed of a particular and appropriate power,
should, for the purpose of giving exercise to such
his power, give them passage through his lips. Of
this latter kind was the present case. The command
issued as above, "he," for it was a he-spirit, "came
out of her," the damsel, "the same hour."</p>

<p>When the devil that Josephus saw expelled, came
out of the man, the channel at which he made his
exit, being manifest, it was accordingly specified: it
was the man's <i>nose</i>. This was something to know:
especially, in relation to an occurrence, the time of
which was at so great a distance from our own. At
the same time, however, other particulars present
themselves, by which curiosity is excited, and for
want of which, the information thus bestowed must
be confessed to be rather imperfect. What the shape
of the devil was? what the substance? whence he last
came? to what place, to what occupation, after being
thus dislodged, he betook himself, and so forth: not
to speak of many others, which howsoever instructive
and satisfactory it would have been to be acquainted
with, yet now that all acquaintance with
them is hopeless, it would be tedious to enumerate.</p>

<p>In the present instance, not only as to all these
particulars, has the historian,&mdash;eyewitness as it
should seem he was of everything that passed,&mdash;left
us in the dark; but, neither has he vouchsafed to
afford us that single article of information, scanty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
as it was, for which, as above, in the case mentioned
by Josephus, we are indebted to Josephus: to Josephus&mdash;that
most respectable and instructive of the
uninspired historians of his age.</p>

<p>In relation to this story, as well as to those others,
the same question still presents itself:&mdash;if told of
the present time,&mdash;if spoken of in some newspaper,
as having happened in the present year,&mdash;exists here
any person, even among the most ignorant populace,
with whom it would obtain any permanent credence?</p>

<p>But, a reported state of things&mdash;which, if reported
as having had place in the present century, would,
by its disconformity to the manifest state of things,
and the whole course of nature, be regarded as too
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'absurb'">absurd</ins> and flagrantly incredible to deserve to be entitled
to a moment's notice,&mdash;what is there that
should render it more credible, when reported as having
happened in this same world of ours, at any anterior
point of time?</p>


<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 5.</h4>

<h5>SUPPOSABLE MIRACLE IV.&mdash;AT PHILIPPI, AN EARTHQUAKE:
PAUL AND SILAS FREED FROM PRISON, A.D. 53.</h5>

<p>The passage, in which these events are related, is
in Acts 16:19-40, inclusive.</p>

<p>On this occasion three principal events are narrated;&mdash;the
incarceration of Paul, an earthquake,
and the liberation of Paul. Between the earthquake
and the liberation of this prisoner, what was in reality
the connection? In the answer there is not much
difficulty: The same as that between the earthquake
and any other event that took place after it. But,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
by an answer thus simple, the purpose of the narrator
would not have been answered: the purpose
was&mdash;to induce, on the part of his readers, the belief&mdash;that
it was for the purpose of bringing about the
liberation of the self-constituted Apostle of Jesus,
that the earth was made to shake. As to the liberation,
by means altogether natural was that event produced:
so he himself has the candour to inform us.
Of this quasi-miracle, or of the last-mentioned one,
Philippi, capital of Macedonia, was the theatre. By
order of the magistrates of that town, Paul and his
attendant had been beaten one evening, and thrown
into prison: next morning, came to the jailor an order
of these same magistrates, and in obedience to it the
prisoners were discharged. That, in the minds of
these magistrates, there was any connection, between
the earthquake and the treatment they had given to
these adventurers, is not so much as insinuated. The
purpose, which it had in view, was answered: it was
the ridding the town of a pair of visitors, whose visit
to it had produced disturbance to existing institutions.
Acts 16:20-40.</p>

<p>Be it as it may with regard to the historiographer,&mdash;that
it was an object with his hero to produce a
notion of a connection between the stripes and the
imprisonment he had undergone on one hand, and
the earthquake on the other, is manifest enough. The
person, in whose mind the prisoner had endeavoured
to produce the idea of such a connection, was the
jailor: and, for its having in this instance been <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'succussful'">successful</ins>,
there seems little difficulty in giving credit
to the historiographer. Everything that appears
to have been said, either of Paul or by Paul, tends
to show the wonderful strength of his mind, and
the facility and promptitude, with which it enabled
him to gain the ascendency over other minds. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
language of the place and time, he had bid the
fortune-telling damsel cease her imposture, and the
imposture ceased. Acts 16:18. Committed to prison
he formed a project for making a proselyte of the
keeper: and, in this too, and in so small a compass of
time as a few hours, there seems reason to believe
he was successful. In his presumption, in daring
to execute the sentence of the law upon so holy a
person, the keeper saw the cause of the earthquake;
and, whether by Paul any very strenuous endeavours
were used to correct so convenient an error in geology,
may be left to be imagined. Paul, when introduced
into the prison, found no want of comrades:
how then happened it, that it was to Paul's imprisonment
that the earthquake, when it happened, was attributed,
and not to any of his fellow-prisoners?
Answer: It happened thus.</p>

<p>Of the trade, which, with such brilliant success,
Paul,&mdash;with this journeyman of his,&mdash;was carrying
on, a set of songs with the name of God for the burthen
of them, constituted a part of the capital, and,
as it should seem, not the least valuable. When midnight
came, Paul&mdash;the trader in godliness&mdash;treated
the company in the prison with a duet: the other
prisoners, though they shared in the benefit of it,
did not join in it. While this duet was performing,
came on the earthquake; and Paul was not such a
novice as to let pass unimproved the opportunity
it put into his hand.</p>

<p>The historiographer, if he is to be believed, was
at this time in Paul's train, as well as Silas; for so,
by the word <i>we</i>, in the tenth verse of this same chapter,
he, as it were, silently informs us. The beating
and the imprisonment were confined to the two principals;
by his comparative insignificance, as it
should seem, the historiographer was saved from it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
From the relation, given to him by Paul or Silas, and
in particular by Paul,&mdash;must this conception, formed
by the historiographer of what passed on the occasion,
have of course been derived. It was coloured
of course in Paul's manner: and in his colouring,
there was of course no want of the marvellous. By
the earthquake, not only were "foundations shaken"
and "doors opened," but "bands loosened." The
"feet" of the two holy men had been "made ... fast
in the stocks," ver. 24: from these same stocks, the
earthquake was ingenious enough to let them out,
and, as far as appears, without hurt: the unholy part
of the prisoners had each of them bands of some sort,
by which they were confined; for, ver. 26, "everyone's
bands were loosed:" in every instance if they
were locked, the earthquake performed the office of
a picklock. Earthquakes in these latter days, we
have but too many, in breaking open doors they find
no great difficulty; but they have no such nicety of
touch as the earthquake, which produced to the self-constituted
Apostle a family of proselytes: they are
no more able to let feet out of the stocks, or hands
out of hand-cuffs, than to make watches.</p>

<p>These elucidations being furnished, the reader is
desired to turn to the text, and lay before him: to
reprint it would require more paper than he might
choose to see thus employed.</p>

<p>As to the name of God and the name of Jesus,
the two names, it should appear, were not&mdash;on the
occasions in question&mdash;used at random. When the
fortune-telling damsel was the subject of Paul's
holy labours, she having been in some way or other
already gained, ver. 17, the case was already of a
sort, in which the name of Jesus Christ, the name
under which the self-constituted Apostle enlisted all
his followers,&mdash;might be employed with advantage.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span></p>

<p>When Paul and Silas were committed to prison, no
such name as that of "Jesus Christ" would as yet
have served. Of "Jesus Christ" neither had the
keeper as yet heard anything, nor had the other
prisoners. But, of God, in some shape or other, they
could not but have heard all of them: <i>God</i> accordingly
was the name, by which at this time the sensibilities
of the persons in question were to be worked
upon. When the earth trembled, the jailor trembled
likewise: he "came trembling and fell down," ver.
29, before Paul and Silas. And brought them out,
ver. 30, and said, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
Now then was the time come for the enlistment&mdash;for
the enlistment in the spiritual warfare against the
devil and his angels: in the as yet new name of "the
Lord Jesus Christ" were these recruits accordingly
enlisted, as now, for the purpose of carnal warfare,
in the name of King George. "And they said," continues
the narration, ver. 31, "Believe in the Lord
Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy
house."</p>

<h4>SECTION 6.</h4>

<h5>SUPPOSABLE MIRACLE V.&mdash;AT CORINTH, PAUL COMFORTED
BY THE LORD IN AN UNSEEN VISION, A.D. 54.&mdash;<i>Acts</i>
18:7-11.</h5>

<p>A vision, being a species of miracle, could, no more
than a pantomime, have place without some expense.
In the present case, as in any other, a natural question
is&mdash;What was the object to be accomplished,
upon which the expense&mdash;whatever it was&mdash;was bestowed?
The answer is&mdash;The keeping his attendants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
whoever they were, in the necessary state of
obsequiousness: for no other is perceptible. To the
dependants in Paul's train, it was no very uncommon
sentiment to be not quite so well satisfied with
the course he took, as he himself was. Corinth was
at this time the theatre of his labours: of the men,
whoever they were, who had staked their fortunes
upon <i>his</i>, some,&mdash;the historiographer, as it should
seem, of the number,&mdash;there were, whose wish it was
to change the scene. In that Gentile city,&mdash;the chief
ruler of the Jewish synagogue, Crispus by name&mdash;this
man, besides another man, of the name of Justus,
"whose house joined hard to" that same synagogue,
had become his converts: "and many of the Corinthians
hearing, believed and were baptized."
Eyes, however, there were, in which the success,
whatsoever it was, was not yet enough to afford a
sufficient warrant for his stay. A vision was necessary,
and a vision accordingly, or at least a something,
which was called by that name, made its appearance.
"Thus spake the Lord," says the historiographer,
ver. 9, "Thus spake the Lord to Paul
in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak,
and hold not thy peace.&mdash;&mdash;For I am with thee,
and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee; for I
have much people in this city." Nor was the vision
without its effect; for, as the next verse informs us,
ver. 11, "He continued <i>there</i> a year and six months,
teaching the word of God among them."</p>

<p>That which, on this occasion, may be believed without
much difficulty is, that the word thus taught by
Paul was Paul's word: and, that which may be believed
with as little, by those, whoever they may be,
who believe in his original conversion-vision, is&mdash;that
it was God's word likewise. From Paul himself
must the account of this vision have been delivered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
to the historiographer: for, unless at the expense of
a sort of miracle, in the shape of an additional vision
at least, if not in some more expensive shape, no information
of any such thing could have reached him.
In these latter days, no ghost is ever seen but in a
<i>tete-a-tete</i>: in those days, no vision, as far as appears,
was ever seen but in the same degree of privacy.
A vision is the word in these pages, because
such is the word in the authoritative translation
made of the historiographer's. That which Paul is
related to have heard, is&mdash;what we have just seen
as above: but that, upon this occasion he saw anything&mdash;that
he saw so much as a flash of light, this
is what we are not told: any more than by what other
means he became so well assured, that the voice
which he heard, supposing him to have heard a voice,
was the Lord's voice. In these latter days,&mdash;inquiries,
of some such sort as these, would as surely
be put, by a counsel who were against the vision,&mdash;as,
in the case of the Cock-lane Ghost, which gave
so much exercise to the faith of the archlexicographer,
were put by the counsel who were against the
ghost; but, by a sort of general understanding,&mdash;than
which nothing can be more convenient,&mdash;inquiries,
such as these,&mdash;how strictly soever in season
when applied to the 19th century of the vulgar
ear, are altogether out of season, as often as they
are applied to the commencement of it.</p>

<p>As to the speaking by a vision, the only intelligible
way, in which any such thing can really have
place, is that, which under the pressure of necessity
has been realized by the ingenuity of dramatists in
these latter days. Such is the mode employed, when
the actors, having been struck dumb by the tyranny
of foolish laws, and consequently having no auditors,
convey to the spectators what information seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
necessary, by an appropriate assortment of gold letters
on a silk ground: whether the Lord who, on this
occasion, according to Paul, spoke to the eyes of
Paul, came provided with any such implement, he
has not informed us. Without much danger of error,
we may venture to assert the negative: for, if such
was the mode of converse, there was nothing but
what might happen without sign or wonder: and, on
this supposition, no addition was made by it, to those
signs and wonders, which, as has been seen, it was his
way to make reference to, in the character of evidence.</p>

<h5>SUPPOSABLE MIRACLE VI.&mdash;AT EPHESUS, DISEASES AND
DEVILS EXPELLED BY FOUL HANDKERCHIEFS.&mdash;<i>Acts</i>
19:1-12.</h5>

<p>At Ephesus, Paul makes a stay of between two and
three years; for "two years" together, disputing
"daily in the school of one Tyrannus," "so that all
they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the
Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.</p>

<p>"And God," continues the history, "wrought
special miracles by the hands of Paul."</p>

<p>These "<i>special</i> miracles," what were they? Of
the whole number, is there so much as a single one
particularized? No; not one. <i>Special</i> as they are, the
following is the account, and the only account given
of them. "So that," continues the history, "from
his body were brought unto the sick, handkerchiefs
or aprons, and the diseases departed from
them, and the evil spirits went out of them."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span></p>

<p>No circumstances whatever particularized, name
of the person, name of the place, description of the
time&mdash;nothing, by means of which, in case of falsity
<i>in toto</i>, or incorrectness in circumstance, the misstatement
might have been exposed,&mdash;to what degree
of credence, or so much as consideration with a
view to credence, vague generalities such as these,
can they present so much as the slightest claim? If
allusions such as these are to pass proof, where is
the imposture, to which proofs&mdash;proofs sufficient in
number and value&mdash;can ever be wanting?</p>

<p>Opposed as Paul was, wherever he went,&mdash;by
gainsayers or persecutors, or both&mdash;sometimes successful,
sometimes altogether unsuccessful,&mdash;sometimes
in a slight degree successful&mdash;in so much as
any one occasion, either in this history, or in any one
of his own numerous Epistles, do we find so much as
a single one of these "<i>special miracles</i>," any more
than of any other miracles, brought to view by him,
or so much as alluded to by him, in the character
of proofs of the commission to which he pretended?
Answer: No, not one.</p>

<p>Diseases cured, evil spirits driven out, by handkerchiefs
and aprons!&mdash;by handkerchiefs and aprons
brought from a man's body! Diseases cured and
devils seared away by foul linen! By Jesus&mdash;by
any one of his Apostles&mdash;were any such implements,
any such eye-traps ever employed? No; never. As
to diseases, if by such means a disease had been <i>propagated</i>,
the case would have been intelligible
enough. But what was wanted was a miracle: and
this would have been no miracle. The price, received
by the holy wearer for any of these cast-off habiliments&mdash;the
price, of the precious effluvia thus conveyed&mdash;by
any such little circumstance, had it been
mentioned, some light might have been cast on what
was done.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span></p>

<p>One thing, indeed, may be stated with some assurance:
and this is&mdash;that, after a man, well or not
well, had received one of these same dirty handkerchiefs,
or of these same dirty aprons, no evil
spirit in him was visible.</p>

<p>One other thing may also be stated with no less
confidence:&mdash;this is that, infection out of the question,
and supposing Paul free from all contagious
disease, if, without handkerchief or apron, the disease
would have had its exit,&mdash;by no such handkerchief
or any such apron was the exit of it prevented.</p>

<p>Note, that all this time, according to this man, the
author of the Acts, he himself was in Paul's suite.
Yet, taking credit for all these miracles&mdash;taking
credit thus for miracles out of number, not so much
as one of them all does he take upon himself to particularize.<a name="FNanchor_78_84" id="FNanchor_78_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_84" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<h4>SECTION 8.</h4>

<h5>SUPPOSABLE MIRACLE VII.&mdash;AT EPHESUS, EXORCISTS
SCEVAS BEDEVILED.&mdash;<i>Acts</i> 19:13-20.</h5>

<p>Thus it is that, as under the last head has been observed,
of all these alleged successful exhibitions,
not so much as a single one is particularized.</p>

<p>In lieu, however, of these successes of Paul's,
something of a story to a certain degree particularized
we have. But this is&mdash;what? a successful
performance of Paul's? No: but an unsuccessful
attempt of certain persons,&mdash;here termed exorcists,&mdash;who
took upon themselves to act against him in
the character of competitors.</p>

<p>Well, then: when the time came for demonstrating
supernatural powers by experiment, these exorcists&mdash;these
impostors, no doubt it was intended they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
should be deemed&mdash;made a very indifferent hand of
it. Good: but the true man, Did he go beyond these
same impostors? Not he, indeed: he did not so
much as attempt it. But, let us hear his historiographer,
who all this while was at his elbow. Acts
19:13-20. "Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists,
took upon them to call over them which had
evil spirits, the name of the Lord Jesus, saying,
We adjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preacheth.</p>

<p>"And there were," continues the narrative, ver.
14, "seven sons of Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the
priests, which did so." Thus far the narrative.</p>

<p>The sons of the chief of the priests? Such men
styled not only <i>exorcists</i> but <i>vagabonds</i>? If they are
not here, in express terms, themselves styled <i>vagabonds</i>,
at any rate, what is here imputed to them is
the doing those same things, the doers of which have
just been styled, not only <i>exorcists</i>, but at the same
time <i>vagabonds</i>. But let us continue, "And the evil
spirit," ver. 15, "answered and said, Jesus, I know,
and Paul I know, but who are ye?&mdash;And the
man, in whom the evil spirit was, leaped on them
and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so
that they fled out of that house naked and
wounded." Thus far the narrative.</p>

<p>To whatsoever order of beings the hero of this
tale may have belonged;&mdash;whatsoever may have been
his proper appellative,&mdash;a man with two natures, one
human, the other diabolical,&mdash;a man with a devil in
him, a madman,&mdash;or a man in his sound senses counterfeiting
a diabolized man or a madman,&mdash;the tale
itself is surely an eminently curious one. Of these
human or superhuman antagonists of his&mdash;of these
pretended masters over evil <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'epirits'">spirits</ins>&mdash;the number is
not less than seven: yet, in comparison of him, so
feeble and helpless are they all together, that he not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
only masters them all seven, but gets them down, all
seven together, and while they are lying on the
ground in a state of disablement, pulls the clothes off
their backs: but whether one after another, or all at
the same time, is not mentioned. Be this as it may,
hereupon comes a question or two. While he was
stripping any one of them, what were the others about
all that time? The beating they received, was it such
as to render them senseless and motionless? No:
this can scarcely have been the case; for, when the
devil had done his worst, and their sufferings were
at the height, out of the house did they flee, wounded
as they were.</p>

<p>"Jesus I know, and Paul I know," says the mysterious
hero, in the fifteenth verse. Hereupon an
observation or two calls for utterance. Supposing
him a man, who, knowing what he was about, counterfeited
the sort of being, who was half man, half
devil,&mdash;one-half of this speech of his, namely, <i>Paul I
know</i>, may without much difficulty be believed. But,
upon this supposition, forasmuch as he acted with
so much effect against these rivals of Paul's,&mdash;a supposition
not less natural, to say the least of it, is&mdash;that
to Paul he was not unknown, any more than Paul
to him: in a word, that on this occasion, between the
evil spirit and the self-constituted Apostle, a sort
of understanding had place. Be this as it may, how
extraordinary a person must he not have been, to
undertake the complete mastery of seven men at
once! Seven men, all of them young enough to have
a father, not only living, but officiating as a priest:
and at the same time, all of them old enough, if not
to exercise, mastery over evil spirits, at any rate to
undertake it!</p>

<p>In Paul's suite, all this time, as far as appears,
was the author of this narrative. The scene thus
exhibited&mdash;was he then, or was he not, himself an eyewitness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
of it? On a point so material and so natural,
no light has he afforded us.</p>

<p>Another circumstance, not less curious, is&mdash;that
it is immediately after the story of the unnamed
multitudes, so wonderfully cured by foul clothes,&mdash;that
this story of the devil-masters discomfited by a
rebellious servant of theirs, makes its appearance.
Turn now to the supposed true devil-master&mdash;on this
score, what was it that he did? Just nothing. The
devil,&mdash;and a most mischievous one he was,&mdash;<i>he</i> was
doing all this mischief:&mdash;the man, who had all such
devils so completely in his power, that they quit
possession, and decamp at the mere sight or smell of
a dirty handkerchief or apron of his;&mdash;he, though
seeing all this mischief done,&mdash;done by this preeminently
mischievous as well as powerful devil,&mdash;still
suffers him to go on;&mdash;and not any the least
restraint in any shape, does he impose upon him;
but leaves him in complete possession of that receptacle,
which, according to the narrative, he wanted
neither the power nor the will to convert into an
instrument of so much mischief. Was it from Paul
himself, that, on this special occasion, for this special
purpose, namely, the putting down these presumptuous
competitors, this mysterious being received
so extraordinary a gift? This is not said, but
not improbably, as it should seem, this was the miracle,
which it was intended by the historian should
be believed.</p>

<p>Occasions there are&mdash;and this we are desired to believe
was one of them&mdash;in which the impossibility of
a thing is no bar to the knowledge of it.</p>

<p>"And this was known," continues the narrative,
ver. 17, "And this was known to all the Jews and
Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus: and fear fell on
them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was
magnified."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, supposing this thing known, the fear stated
as the result of it may without difficulty be believed:&mdash;fear
of being treated as those sons of the chief of
the Jewish priests had been: fear of the devil, by
whom those, his unequal antagonists, had been thus
dealt with: fear of the more skilful devil-master,
under whose eye these bunglers had been thus dealt
with.</p>

<p>But the name here said to be <i>magnified</i>&mdash;the name
of the Lord Jesus&mdash;how <i>that</i> came to be <i>magnified</i>:
in this lies all the while the difficulty, and it seems
no small one.</p>

<p>The <i>name</i>, on this occasion, and thus said to be
employed, whose was it? It was, indeed, the Lord
Jesus's. But was it successful? Quite the contrary.
It made bad worse. In the whole of this business,
what was there from which the name of Jesus could
in any shape receive magnification? Yes: if after
the so eminently unsuccessful use, thus made of it
by those exorcists, a successful use had, on the same
occasion, been made of it by Paul. But, no: no such
enterprise did he venture upon. Madman, devil,
counterfeit madman, counterfeit devil,&mdash;by proxy,
any of these he was ready to encounter, taking for
his proxy one of his foul handkerchiefs or aprons:
any of this sort of work, if his historiographer is to
be believed, he was ready enough to do by proxy.
But, in person? No; he knew better things.</p>

<p>"And many that believed," concludes this part of
the narrative, ver. 18, "came and confessed, and
showed their deeds." Yes; supposing there were
any, by whom all this or any part of it was believed,&mdash;that
they spoke and acted in consequence, may be
believed without much difficulty: and, with this observation
may the story, and the sort of elucidation
endeavouring to be given of it, be left to close.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span></p>

<h4>SECTION 9.</h4>

<h5>SUPPOSABLE MIRACLE VIII.&mdash;MAGICAL BOOKS BURNT
BY THE OWNERS.&mdash;<i>Acts</i> 19:19, 20.</h5>

<p>Such as it was, the supposable miracle last mentioned
was not without its supposed fruit: destruction
of property, such as it was&mdash;destruction of property,
and to an amount sufficiently wonderful for the
satisfaction of any ordinary appetite for wonders.
But let us see the text. It follows in the verse 19,
next after that, in which mention is made, as in the
last preceding section, of what was done by the
"many who believed."</p>

<p>"Many of them also," ver. 19, "which used curious
arts, brought their books together, and burned
them before all men; and they counted the price of
them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver."
"So mightily," ver 20, "grew the word of God, and
prevailed." And there ends the story of the books
of curious arts.</p>

<p>As to the sum total, nothing can be more precise:
as to the items, could the list of them be but produced,
this would be indeed a treasure. As to the
denomination <i>magical</i>, given in the title of this section
to those books, styled books "<i>of curious arts</i>,"&mdash;in
the text, short is the only apology that need be
made for it. Of the number of those <i>curious arts</i>
could not, most assuredly, have been any of the arts
included at present under the name of <i>fine arts</i>; of
the character of the <i>arts</i> here designated by the appellation
of <i>curious</i>, a sufficient indication is afforded
by the story, by which the mention of them is, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
above, immediately preceded. They were the arts,
by which effects were undertaken to be produced,
such as the self-constituted Apostle undertook to
produce by so much more simple means. How vast
soever were the collection, what would be the value
of it,&mdash;the whole taken together,&mdash;when so much
more than could be done by everything which it professed
to teach, could be done by about a score or a
dozen words, on the single condition, that the lips
by which they were uttered were properly commissioned
lips, not to speak of the still more simple operation
of the touch of a used handkerchief?</p>

<p>Of the state of art and science in the wake of the
great temple of Diana, the representation here given
is of itself no small curiosity. Books of curious arts&mdash;all
of them arts of imposture&mdash;books, employed,
all of them, in teaching the most secret of all secrets&mdash;books
of this description, so well known to all men,
as to bear a market-price! a market-price, so well
known to all men, as if it were the price of bread
and butcher's meat: and, in the single town of Ephesus,
these books so numerous,&mdash;such the multitude
or the value,&mdash;or rather the multitude as well as
value, of them taken in the aggregate, that the price,
that had been given for such of them as were thus
given up, and which are only part, and, as it should
seem by the word <i>many</i>, not the larger part, of the
whole number, of those, which, at that same place,
were at that same time in existence,&mdash;was, upon
summing up, found actually to amount, so we are required
to believe, to that vast sum.</p>

<p>Of the aggregate, of the prices that had been paid,
we are told, for this smaller part of the aggregate
number of the books, then and there existing on
this single subject,&mdash;inadequate, indeed, would our
conception be of it were we to regard it as not exceeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
the value of the whole library collected by King
George the Third, and given by his successor to the
English part of his subjects. <i>Data</i>, though not for
numeration, yet sufficient for conception, are by no
means wanting. To consult Arbuthnot, or any successor
of his, would be mere illusion; in so far as the
value of money is unknown, prices in money serve
but to deceive. History&mdash;and <i>that</i> the most appropriate
history&mdash;has furnished us with much surer
grounds. Thirty pieces of silver, Matt. 28:3-10, was
the purchase-money of the field, called <i>the potters'
field</i>, bought for a burying-ground, with the money
received and returned by the traitor, Judas, as the
reward for his treachery. Suppose it no more than
half an acre. What, in English money of the present
day, would be the value of half an acre of land in or
close by a closely built metropolis? A hundred
pounds would, assuredly, be a very moderate allowance.
Multiply the hundred pounds by fifty thousand,
you have five millions; divide the five millions
by thirty, you have, on the above supposition, 166,666<i>l</i>.
and odd for the value of these books. Look to
the English translation, look to the Greek original,
the pieces of silver are the same.</p>

<h4>SECTION 10.</h4>

<h5>SUPPOSABLE MIRACLE IX.&mdash;AT TROAS, EUTYCHUS FOUND
NOT TO BE DEAD.&mdash;<i>Acts</i> 20:7-12.</h5>

<p>In this story may be seen another example, of the
facility with which, when men are upon the hunt for
miracles, something may be made out of nothing:
the most ordinary occurrence, by the addition of a
loose word or two, metamorphosed into a miracle.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span></p>

<p>Paul, one evening, was treating his disciples with
a sermon: he was at the same time treating them,
or they him, with a supper. The architecture of the
house was such, that, under favourable circumstances,
a fall might be got from the top of it, or
thereabouts, to the bottom, without much difficulty.
If any difficulty there was, on the occasion in question
it was overcome. According to circumstances,
sermons produce on different minds different effects:
from some, they drive sleep; in others, they produce
it. On the occasion in question, the latter was the
effect experienced by a certain youth. His station
is represented as being an elevated one:&mdash;so elevated
that, after the fall he got from it, it may be believed
without difficulty, he lay for some time motionless.
Paul "went down" to him, we are told, and embraced
him. The youth received the embrace; Paul,
the praise of tender-heartedness:&mdash;this is what may
be asserted with a safe conscience, though it be without
any special evidence. Trifling, however, is the
boon he received from that congregation, in comparison
of what he has been receiving from so many
succeeding ones&mdash;the reputation of having made so
brilliant an addition to the catalogue of his miracles.
By the accident, whatever may have been the interruption,
given by it to the festivity, no end was put
to it. Sermon and supper ended, the rest of the congregation
went their way: and with them went the
youth, to whom had anything serious happened, the
historian would scarcely have left us uninformed
of it.</p>

<p>On this occasion, between the hero and his historian,
there is somewhat of a difference. The historian
will have it, that when Paul reached the body
he found it dead. Paul's own account of the matter
is the direct contrary: so the historian himself informs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
us. Here then the historian and his hero are
at issue. But, the historian, having the first word,
makes, if we may venture to say so, a rather unfair
advantage of it, and by this same first word gives a
contradiction to what he makes his hero say in the
next. "He was taken up dead," says the historian,
who was or was not there: "His life is in him," says
the preacher, who was there beyond dispute.</p>

<p>But let us see the text.</p>

<h5>ACTS 20:7-12.</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>7. And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came
together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart
on the morrow, and continued his speech till midnight.&mdash;And there
were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered
together.&mdash;And there sat in a window a certain young man named
Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long
preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third
loft, and was taken up dead.&mdash;And Paul went down, and fell on him,
and embracing him, said, Trouble not yourselves, for his life is in
him.&mdash;When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread,
and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he
departed.&mdash;And they brought the young man alive, and were not a
little comforted.<br /><br /></p></div>

<p>At this time of day, any such contrariety might
produce some embarrassment; but, when it is considered
how long ago the thing happened, no such
uneasy sensation is experienced. A supposition, by
which all embarrassment is excluded, is so immediately
obvious, as to be scarce worth mentioning.
When Paul reached the body, the soul was already
in the other world; but, with the kisses goes a whisper,
and the soul comes back again. Whether from
indolence or from archness, there is something amusing
in the course the historian takes for enlivening
his narration with these flowers: he sketches out the
outline, but leaves it to our imaginations to fill it up.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 11.</h4>

<h5>SUPPOSABLE MIRACLE X.&mdash;ON SHIPBOARD, PAUL COMFORTED
BY AN ANGEL.</h5>

<h5>ACTS 27:20-25.</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>And when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no
small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be preserved was
thenceforth taken away.&mdash;But after long abstinence Paul stood in the
midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened to me, and
not have loosed from Crete, but have prevented this harm and
damage.&mdash;And now I exhort you to be of good courage: for there
shall be no loss of life among you, but of the ship, <i>there shall be loss</i>.&mdash;For
there stood by me this night an angel of that God, whose I am,
and whom I serve, saying,&mdash;Fear not, Paul, thou must be brought
before Caesar; and lo, God hath graciously given to thee all who
sail with thee.&mdash;Wherefore, Sirs, be of good courage: for I believe
God, that it will be as it hath been told me.<br /><br /></p></div>

<p>The sea being stormy, the crew are alarmed. The
storm, however, is not so violent, but that Paul is
able to make a speech, and they to hear it. To keep
up their spirits, and, at the same time, let them see
the sort of terms he is upon with the Almighty, he
tells them a story about an angel. The angel had
been sent to him upon a visit, and was but just gone.
The business of the angel was to quiet the mind of
the Apostle. The matter had been settled. The
precious life was in no danger: and, not only so, but,
out of compliment to him, God had been pleased to
grant to him the lives of all who were happy enough
to be in his company.</p>

<p>In the situation, in which so many lives are represented
as being placed,&mdash;no very severe condemnation
can easily be passed upon any little fraud, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
which they might be saved. But, is it really to be
believed, that this angel, whom, in a deckless vessel,
for the vessels of <i>those</i> times were not like the vessels
of present times, no person but Paul either saw
or heard, was really sent express from the sky by
God Almighty, on such an errand? If not, then have
we this additional proof,&mdash;if any additional proof
can be needed,&mdash;to help to satisfy us,&mdash;that, where
a purpose was to <ins title="Transcriber's Note: missing word 'be' added">be</ins> answered, falsehood, or as he
would have called it <i>lying</i>, was not among the obstacles,
by which Paul would be stopped, in his endeavours
to accomplish it.</p>


<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 12.</h4>

<h5>SUPPOSABLE MIRACLE XI.&mdash;AT MALTA, A REPTILE
SHAKEN OFF BY PAUL WITHOUT HURT.&mdash;<i>Acts</i> 28:1-6.</h5>

<p>A fire of sticks being kindled, a reptile, here called
a viper, is represented as "coming out of the heat,"
and fastening on Paul's hand. On beholding this
incident,&mdash;"the barbarous people," as the inhabitants
are called, whose hospitality kindled the fire
for the relief of the shipwrecked company, concluded
that Paul was a murderer: and were, accordingly,
in expectation of seeing him "swollen, or fallen down
dead suddenly." Nothing of this sort happened,
their next conclusion was, <i>that he was a God</i>. As such,
did these barbarians, as did the civilized inhabitants
of Lystra, sacrifice to him, or in any other way worship
him? No: these conceptions of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'their'">theirs</ins> reported,
there the story ends.</p>

<p>Of this story, what is to be made? At this time of
day, among Christians in general, what we should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
expect to find is, that it passed for a miracle. But,
if by miracle is meant, not merely an accident, somewhat
singular and extraordinary,&mdash;but, by a special
act of Almighty power, an effect produced, by means
disconformable to the uniform course of nature,&mdash;it
might be too much to say, that even by the reporter
himself, it is for the decided purpose of its being
taken for miracle, that it is brought to view.</p>

<p>If, however, the design was not here, that the incident
should be taken for a miracle,&mdash;the story
amounted to nothing, and was not worth the telling.
But, if it <i>is</i> to be made into a miracle, where is the
matter in it, out of which a miracle can be made?</p>

<p>The reptile&mdash;was it really a viper? Neither the
barbarians of Malta, nor the reporter of this story,
nor in a word, at that time of day, any other persons
whatever, were either very complete or very
correct, in their conception of matters belonging to
the field of natural history. At present, reptiles are
crawling creatures. At this time of day, when
<i>leeches</i> are excepted, to fasten upon the part they
have bitten is not the practice with any reptiles that
we know of. If, instead of <i>viper</i>, the Greek word had
been one that could have been translated <i>leech</i>,&mdash;the
story would have been probable enough, but, were
it only for that very reason, no miracle could have
been made out of it. Shaken down into the fire, that
is, into the burning fuel,&mdash;a small reptile, such as a
leech, how brisk soever in the water, would be very
apt to be overpowered by the heat, before it could
make its escape: with a reptile of the ordinary size
of a viper, this would hardly be the case.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, "he felt,"&mdash;so says the story,&mdash;"he
felt no harm." How came it that he felt no
harm? Because the Almighty performed a miracle
to preserve him from harm? So long as eyes are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
open, causes out of number&mdash;causes that have nothing
wonderful in them&mdash;present themselves to view
before this. "The beast," as it is translated, "was
not a viper":&mdash;if really a viper, it happened, at that
moment, not to be provided with a competent stock
of venom: it had already expended it upon some other
object:&mdash;by some accident or other, it had lost the
appropriate tooth. Not to look out for others,&mdash;any
mind that was not bent upon having a miracle at
any price, would lay hold of some such cause as one
of these, sooner than give itself any such trouble as
that of torturing the incident into a miracle.</p>

<p>To bring under calculation the quantity of supernatural
power necessary to the production of a given
effect is no very easy task. At any rate,&mdash;without
more or less of expense in a certain shape, nothing
in that way could ever be done. In the case here in
question, what could have been the object of any such
expense? Was it the saving the self-constituted
Apostle the pain of a bite? The expense then,
would it not have been less&mdash;the operation, so to
speak, more economical&mdash;had a slight turn been given
to Paul's hand, or to the course of the reptile? But,
in either case, neither would the name of the Lord,
nor&mdash;what was rather more material&mdash;that of his
Apostle, have received that glorification which was
so needful to it.</p>

<p>Any such design, as that of giving an unequivocal
manifestation of Almighty power, such as should
stand the test of scrutiny, testifying the verity of
Paul's commission to the end of time,&mdash;any such design
could the incident have had for its final cause?
A more equivocal,&mdash;a less conclusive,&mdash;proof of the
manifestation of supernatural power, seems not very
easy to imagine.</p>

<p>Here then comes once more the so often repeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
conclusion:&mdash;the narrative began to be in want of a
miracle, and the miracle was made.</p>

<p>In those days, among that people, miracles were
so much in course, that without a reasonable number
of them, a history would hardly have obtained credence:
at any rate it would not have obtained readers,
and without readers no history can ever obtain
much credence.</p>

<h5>SUPPOSABLE MIRACLE XII.&mdash;AT MALTA, DEPUTY
PUBLIUS'S FATHER CURED.&mdash;<i>Acts</i> 28:7-10.</h5>

<p>"In the same quarters," says the story&mdash;it follows
immediately upon that of the viper. "In the
same quarters were possessions of the chief man of
the island, whose name was <i>Publius</i>, who received
us and lodged us three days courteously.&mdash;And
it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick
of a fever, and of a bloody flux, to whom Paul entered
in and prayed, and laid his hands on him and
healed him.&mdash;So when this was done, others also
which had diseases in the island, came and were
healed.&mdash;Who also honoured us with many honours,
and when we departed, they laded us with
such things as were necessary."</p>

<p>Of the fevers, which, within the compass of any
given spot, and any given space of time, have place,
it almost always happens, that a certain number go
off of themselves. Of, perhaps, all sorts of fever,&mdash;at
least of almost all sorts at present known, thus
much is agreed upon by all physicians:&mdash;they have
at least two regular courses, one of which terminates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
in death, the other or others in recovery. Supposing
the person in question to have had a fever,&mdash;what is
pretty clear is&mdash;that, if <i>of itself</i>, it would have taken
a favourable termination, there was nothing, in the
forms employed by Paul, viz., utterance of prayers
and imposition of hands, that could have any natural
tendency to <i>cause</i> it to take an unfavourable one.</p>

<p>But&mdash;the course afterwards taken by the fever,
was there anything in it to distinguish it from the
ordinary favourable course? If not, in that case, so
far from miraculous, there is nothing that is so much
as wonderful in the case.</p>

<p>Note here two things&mdash;the narrator one of the
party; the narrative so loose and uncircumstantial.
But <i>to see</i> is one thing; <i>to narrate</i>, another.</p>

<p>Three days, it seems, and no more, did Paul and
his suite stay at the house of this Publius. Was it
during that time, or not till afterwards, that Paul
performed on him those ceremonies, of which healing
is represented as having been the consequence? Was
it within that same space of time, or not till afterwards,
that the healing is supposed to have taken
place? As to the English word <i>healing</i>, it cannot be
accused of being indecisive. But in some languages
they have words, by which a very convenient veil is
thrown over the result. In the languages in question,
for the endeavour to heal, whether successful
or unsuccessful, the word employed is the same. The
Latin affords one of these convenient words, <i>curo</i>.
The Greek has another, <i>iasato</i>, and in the Greek original
of this history, this is the word employed.</p>

<p>In a case where a ceremony and nothing else is
trusted to, it being supposed that the patient really
has the disease, the safe and prudent course is, so
to order times and seasons, that between the time
of performing the ceremony, and the time at which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
restoration to health is expected to take place, the
time shall have come for the practitioner to have
shifted quarters; for, in this case, this is an interval
more or less considerable during which it being taken
for granted that the desired result will take place
of course, reward, in the shapes of profit and honour,
will pour in upon the scientific head.</p>

<p>Here, as elsewhere, not only no <i>symptoms</i> are particularized,
but no <i>place</i> is mentioned: no <i>time</i> is
particularized, no <i>persons</i> are mentioned as <i>percipient
witnesses</i>: even the individual who was the
subject of the cure is not mentioned by name.</p>

<p>As to the givers of the supposed honours and presents&mdash;persons
are indeed mentioned:&mdash;mentioned,
but no otherwise than by the name of <i>others</i>. One
individual alone is particularized: particularized as
having received the benefit of these ceremonies. This
is the father of Publius. This man, to use the phraseology
of the passage, was <i>also healed</i>. But&mdash;this man
who was he? He was no less a person than the
father of the chief man in the island. Well then,
what are the honours, what the allotment of "<i>such
things as were necessary</i>?" What were the proofs
of gratitude, afforded by this man, who was so much
better able to afford such presents, than any of those
other persons cured? By such proofs of remuneration,
some evidence&mdash;some circumstantial evidence,&mdash;supposing
them exhibited at a proper time, would
have been afforded, in proof of the reality of the service.
But, neither by the person thus spoken of as
healed, nor by his son&mdash;the chief man in the island,&mdash;is
it said that any such proofs were afforded. For
such a silence when the case of an individual was
brought to view, coupled with the express declaration
made, of gifts presented by persons unnamed,&mdash;three
cases cannot but present themselves, as being any one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
of them more probable, than that, on this occasion, a
real miracle was performed. One is&mdash;that there was
no disease, perhaps no such person: another is, that
though there was a disease, it went off of itself: the
third is, that it never went off at all.</p>

<p>One thing may be asserted without much fear of
contradiction: and that is, that in this country, if
in terms such as these, accounts were inserted in the
public prints;&mdash;accounts of diseases cured without
medicine;&mdash;diseases cured by nothing but words and
gesticulations;&mdash;though the accounts given were ever
so numerous, not the smallest notice would they be
thought worthy of,&mdash;not the smallest attention would
they receive from anyone, unless it were for the
joke's sake.</p>

<p>What is more,&mdash;numerous are the publications, in
which, encompassed with circumstantiality in all
manner of shapes, not only the names of the fortunate
patients are mentioned, but under the signatures
of those patients declarations made, assuring
the public of the reality of the cure,&mdash;and yet, when at
the same time, by competent persons, due inquiry
has been made, it turns out after all that no such
cure has been performed.</p>

<p>Accounts, which would not be believed were they
to come out at a time of so widely diffused knowledge,
are they to be believed, merely because the
time they belonged to,&mdash;facts and accounts together,&mdash;was,
as to all such matters, a time of universal ignorance?
The less a man understands the subject,
the more firmly is he to be believed, as to everything
he says of it? Or is it that, between then and now,
<i>men</i> and <i>things</i> have undergone a total change? and,
if so, when did it take place?</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 14.</h4>

<h5>CONCLUSION: THE SUPPOSABLE MIRACLES CLASSED AND
SUMMED UP.</h5>

<p>Inferences,&mdash;conveying more or less of instruction,&mdash;may,
perhaps, be found deducible,&mdash;at any rate
our conception of the whole series taken together,
will be rendered so much the clearer, by bringing the
same supposed marvels again under review, arranged
in the order of time.</p>

<p>For this purpose, the time may be considered as
divided into three periods.</p>

<p>In the first are included&mdash;those, which are represented
as having had place during the time when at
the outset of his missionary expedition, Paul had
Barnabas for his associate. Of these there are two,
viz. 1. At Paphos, A.D. 45, Sorcerer Elymas blinded.
2. At Lystra, A.D. 46, cripple cured. Of this part of
the expedition, the commencement, as in the current
account, placed in the year 45.</p>

<p>In the second period are included&mdash;those, which
are represented as having had place, during the time
when Paul, after his separation from Barnabas, had
Silas for his associate, and the unnamed author of
the Acts for an attendant. This ends with his arrival
at Jerusalem, on the occasion of his fourth visit&mdash;the
Invasion Visit.</p>

<p>In the current accounts, this event is placed in
the year 60. Within this period, we have the seven
following supposed marvels: 1. At Philippi, A.D.
53, divineress silenced. 2. At Philippi, A.D. 53,
earthquake: Paul and Silas freed <b>from prison</b>. 3.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
At Corinth, A.D. 54, Paul comforted by the Lord in
an unseen vision. 4. At Ephesus, A.D. 56, diseases
and devils expelled by Paul's foul handkerchiefs. 5.
At Ephesus, A.D. 55, Exorcist Scevas bedeviled. 6.
At Ephesus, A.D. 56, magic books burned by the
owners. 7. At Troas, A.D. 59, Eutychus found not
to be dead.</p>

<p>In the third period are included&mdash;those which are
represented as having had place, in the interval
between his forced departure from Jerusalem for
Rome, and his arrival at Rome.</p>

<p>In the current accounts, this event is placed in the
year 62. Within this concluding period, we have the
following supposed marvels: 1. On shipboard, A.D.
62, Paul comforted by an angel. 2. At Malta, A.D.
62, a reptile shaken off by Paul without his being
hurt. 3. At Malta, A.D. 62, Deputy Publius's father
cured by Paul of some disorder. Year of all these
three last marvels, the same as that of Paul's arrival
at Rome. Total number of supposed marvels, twelve.</p>

<p>To the first of these three periods belong two supposed
marvels, which, supposing them to have any
foundation in truth, present themselves as being, in
a greater degree than most of the others, exposed
to the suspicion of contrivance. A moderate sum,
greater or less according to the state more or less
flourishing of his practice, might suffice to engage a
sorcerer, for a few minutes or hours, to declare himself
struck blind: a still more moderate sum might
suffice to engage an itinerant beggar, to exhibit himself
with one leg tied up, and after hearing what was
proper to be heard, or seeing what was proper to be
seen, to declare himself cured.</p>

<p>This was the period, during which Paul had Barnabas,
or Barnabas Paul, for an associate. In these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
cases, if fraud in any shape had place,&mdash;it is not without
reluctance, that any such supposition could be
entertained, as that Barnabas&mdash;the generous, the
conciliating, the beneficent, the persevering Barnabas&mdash;was
privy to it. But, times and temptation considered,
even might this supposition be assented to,
on rather more substantial grounds, than that which
stands in competition with it: namely, that for the
production of two effects,&mdash;comparatively so inconsiderable,
and not represented as having been followed
by any determinate effects of greater moment,&mdash;the
ordinary course of nature was, by a special
interposition of Almighty power, broken through
and disturbed.</p>

<p>Is it or is it not a matter worth remarking&mdash;that,
of all these twelve supposed occurrences, such as
they are,&mdash;in not more than four is the hero represented,&mdash;even
by his own attendant, historian, and
panegyrist,&mdash;as decidedly taking any active part in
the production of the effect? These are&mdash;the blinding
of the sorcerer, the cure of the cripple, the silencing
of the divineress, the curing of Deputy Publius's
father: the three first, at the commencement of this
supposed wonder-working part of his career; the
last,&mdash;with an interval of fifteen years between that
and the first,&mdash;at the very close of it. In the eight
intermediate instances, either the effect itself
amounted to nothing, or the hero is scarcely represented
as being instrumental in the production of it.
These are&mdash;the being let out of prison after an earthquake
had happened&mdash;being comforted, whether by
God or man, in a vision or without one&mdash;having handkerchiefs,
by which, when he had done with them, diseases
and devils were expelled&mdash;being present when a
gang of exorcists were beaten and stripped by a devil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
whom they had undertaken to drive out of a man&mdash;being
in a place, in which some nonsensical books
were burned by their owners&mdash;being in a house, in
which a youth said to be dead, was found not to be
so&mdash;being comforted by an angel, who had the kindness
to come on board ship uninvited&mdash;shaking off
a reptile, without being hurt by it.</p>

<p>Whatever store may be set at this time of day
upon all these marvels, less cannot easily be set upon
them by anybody than was by Paul himself. For
proof, take the whole tenor of his own Epistles, as
well as the whole tenor of his visions, as delivered
by his attendant. Numberless as were the scrapes he
got himself into,&mdash;numberless as were the hosts of
enemies he everywhere made himself,&mdash;open as all
ears were to everything that presented itself as
marvellous,&mdash;unable as men were to distinguish what
could be done from what could not be done,&mdash;pressing
as was at all times the need he had of evidence,
that could arrest the hands of enemies,&mdash;on no occasion
do we find him calling into his aid, so much as a
single one of all these supposed irrefragable evidences.</p><hr class="tb" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span></p>

was this? Answer, see chap. 15:37 to 40. This appears to have
been that John, whose surname was Mark, who was the cause of the
angry separation of Paul from Barnabas.</p></div>

chapter, as having been carried on by him in this same place,
namely, Ephesus,&mdash;and which, where circumstances created a demand
for the article, appears to have been more profitable than that of
expelling devils or diseases,&mdash;is <i>that</i>, of which the Holy Ghost was
the subject. This power of conferring&mdash;that is to say, of being
thought to confer&mdash;the Holy Ghost,&mdash;such, and of such sort was the
value of it, that Simon Magus, as there may be occasion to mention
in another chapter, had, not less than one-and-twenty years before
this, offered the Apostles money for it. Acts 8:18-24, A.D. 34.
This power, two preceding verses of the same 19th chapter, namely
the 5th and 6th, represent Paul as exercising: and, whatsoever was
the benefit derived, twelve is the number of the persons here spoken
of as having received it.
</p>
<p>
Acts 19:5-7. After "they," the above twelve, v. 7, disciples, v. 9,
"were baptized, v. 5, in the name of the Lord Jesus;" when Paul,
v. 6, "had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them;
and they spake with tongues, and prophesied." Here then, if, by
thus laying on of hands, it is by <i>Paul</i> that any operation is performed,
it is the conferring of "the Holy Ghost." But this power, whence
had Paul received it? Not from Jesus, had the self-constituted
Apostle received this gift, whatever it was, any more than he had
baptism, by which ceremony, as appears from Acts 8:16, it was
regularly preceded: as in the case of the magician it actually had
been. Not from Jesus: no such thing is anywhere so much as
pretended. Not from the Apostles, or any of them; from two, for
example, by commission from the rest&mdash;as in the case of Peter and
John, Acts 8:14-19:&mdash;no such thing is anywhere so much as pretended.
In no such persons could this&mdash;would this&mdash;their self-declared
superior, have vouchsafed to acknowledge the existence,
of a power in which he had no share. On this occasion, as on
every other, independently of the Apostles did he act, and in spite
of the Apostles.
</p>
<p>
As to the "<i>speaking with tongues and prophesying</i>," these are
pretensions, which may be acknowledged without much difficulty.
<i>Tongues</i> are the organs most men speak with. As to <i>prophesying</i>,
it was an operation that might as well be performed after the fact
as before the fact: witness in Luke 22:64, "Prophesy, who is it
that smote thee?" Read the Bible over from beginning to end, a
<i>prophet</i>, whatever else be meant, if there be anything else meant, you
will find to have been <i>a politician: to prophesy</i> was to talk <i>politics</i>.
Make a new translation, or, what would be shorter, a list of
<i>corrigenda</i>, and instead of <i>prophet</i> put <i>politician</i>,&mdash;a world of labour,
now employed in explanations, will be saved.</p></div></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3><i>Acts, part false, part true: Author not Saint Luke.</i></h3>


<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 1.</h4>

<h5>BY THE FALSE PARTS, THE GOSPEL NOT AFFECTED: MOST
PARTS TRUE.</h5>

<p>In regard to the Acts, a notion, generally, not to
say universally, received, is&mdash;that it had Saint Luke
for its author: and that, accordingly, it may with propriety
be regarded as a continuation of the Gospel
of that Evangelist, written by the same hand. Were
this conception a correct one, whatsoever shock were
given to the credit of the Acts, would unavoidably
extend itself to the Gospel history: at any rate, to
that part of it which bears the name of Luke.</p>

<p>Before this chapter is at an end,&mdash;the reader, if
the author is not much mistaken, will not only be
convinced that that opinion is untenable, but see no
small ground for wondering, how by any person, by
whom any survey had been taken of the two objects
in that point of view, any such notion should ever
have come to be entertained.</p>

<p>Another memento, of which, if made before, even
the repetition may in this place, perhaps, be not
without its use, is&mdash;that, from nothing that is here
said, is any such conception meant to be conveyed,
as that the history called <i>The Acts</i>, is from beginning
to end, like that of Geoffrey of Monmouth's <i>History</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
<i>of Britain</i>, a mere falsity. In a great part, perhaps
even by much the greatest, it is here looked upon
as true: in great part true, although in no inconsiderable
part incorrect, to say no worse: and, in particular,
on every point, on which the colour of the marvellous
is visible. As to the sort and degree of evidence
due to it, one general assumption there is, by
which the whole of this inquiry has, from first to last,
been guided. This is&mdash;that, in relation to one and
the same work, whatsoever be the subject of it, credence
may, without inconsistency or impropriety, by
one and the same person, be given and withholden:
given, on this or that occasion; withholden, on this
or that other occasion: given, in so far as the truth
of the contents seems probable; withholden, as far
as it seems improbable.</p>

<p>For the support of this assumption,&mdash;all that, on
the present occasion, can be offered, is&mdash;an appeal
to universal experience. As to the general foundations
of the law of evidence,&mdash;for any excursion into
so wide an expanse, neither this chapter nor any
other part of this work would, it has been thought, be
generally regarded as a proper place. What had been
written on that subject has accordingly been discarded.</p>


<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 2.</h4>

<h5>TIME BETWEEN RESURRECTION AND ASCENSION&mdash;ACTS
CONTRADICTS LUKE.</h5>

<p>In the first place then, Saint Luke cannot have been
the author of the Acts.</p>

<p>The reason is very simple. In respect of the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
between Jesus's resurrection and his ascension,&mdash;the
one of these narratives gives one account, the other,
another account: and, so wide is the difference between
the two, that by one and the same person they
could not have both been given. According to Saint
Luke, the time during which, after his resurrection,
and before his ascension, Jesus was seen by his disciples,
extended not beyond <i>one</i> day: according to
the Acts, it extended as far as <i>forty</i> days. By Saint
Luke, that the time was not more than a day, is not
indeed said in so many words; but upon examination
of the text, it will be found, that, consistently
with the particulars given, no longer duration can
be assigned to it. In the Acts, that the time, during
which he continued showing himself after his <i>passion</i>,
Acts 1:3,<a name="FNanchor_79_85" id="FNanchor_79_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_85" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> to the Apostles, was "<i>forty days</i>,"
is affirmed in those very words.</p>

<p>The point here in question, be it observed, is not
<i>truth</i>, but <i>consistency</i>: not the truth of either of the
two accounts; but their consistency, the one with the
other: and, instead of consistency, so palpable is the
inconsistency, that the conclusion is,&mdash;by no one man,
who did not, on one or other of the two occasions,
intend thereby to deceive, can both of them, morally
speaking, have been penned.</p>

<p>Now for the proof. First, let us hear Saint Luke:
it is all of it in his last chapter&mdash;the 24th. In
verse 10, mention is made of certain women, three
named, others not named. In verses 2 and 3, "they
entered into," it is said, "the sepulchre," ver. 2,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
and found not the body of the Lord Jesus." In ver.
9, "they returned," it is said, "from the sepulchre,
and told all these things to the eleven, and to all
the rest." Thereupon it is, that, of all them,
"two" ver. 13, of whom Cleopas, ver. 18, was one,
"went <i>that same day</i> to Emmaus, which was from
Jerusalem about sixty furlongs: and while they
communed together," it was that "Jesus," ver. 15,
"drew near, and went with them," whereupon between
him and them a conversation therein reported,
ensued. The conversation,&mdash;the same conversation,
as reported in verses from 16 to 27,&mdash;continues till
their arrival at the village, ver. 28, namely, Emmaus,
as per ver. 13. According to the next verse, ver. 29,
"the day," namely, that same day, "being far
spent," at that same place, "he went in to tarry
with them," they having "constrained him." Then
also it is that, ver. 30, "he sat at meat with them:"
and, ver. 31, "they knew him, and he vanished out
of their sight." Moreover, "at that same hour" it
is, ver. 33, that "they returned to Jerusalem, and
found the eleven gathered together, and them that
were with them, saying," ver. 34, "The Lord is
risen indeed, and hath appeared unto Simon." Then
it is also, that, ver. 36, they reporting what had
passed, "as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood
in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace
be unto you." Thereupon follows a conversation,
reported in verses from 37 to 49, in the course
of which he, ver. 43, "did eat before them." Then it
is, that, immediately after the last words, which, in
ver. 49, he is stated to have uttered, come these
words, ver. 50, "And he led them out as far as to
Bethany, and he lifted up his hands and blessed
them. And it came to pass," says the next verse,
ver. 51, "while he blessed them, he was parted from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
them, and carried up into heaven. And they worshipped
him," continues the next verse, ver. 52,
"and returned to Jerusalem with great joy." And,
with the next verse, which says, "they were continually
in the temple, praising and blessing God,"&mdash;the
chapter, and with it the Gospel, ends.</p>

<p>So much for Saint Luke. Now for the author
of the Acts, chapter 1, ver. 3, "To whom," says he,
namely the Apostles, ver. 2, "he," namely Jesus, ver.
1, "showed himself alive after his passion by many
infallible proofs, being seen of them <i>forty</i> days...."</p>

<p>Thus while, according to the author of the Acts
the time&mdash;during which Jesus was seen by the persons
in question was not less than <i>forty</i> days,&mdash;according
to Saint Luke, the whole time, during
which this same Jesus was seen by those same persons,
was not more than <i>one</i> day. And who was this
historian, who, on the supposition of the identity,
speaking of this all-important scene, on one occasion
says, that it lasted no more than <i>one</i> day; and, on
another occasion, professing, Acts 1:1, to be giving
continuance to such his former discourse, declares,
in so many words, that it lasted "forty days"? It
is Saint Luke, one of the Apostles of Jesus;&mdash;one,
of the eleven, before whose eyes, everything of that
which has just been read, is stated as having passed.</p>

<p>With all this before him, does the editor of the
edition of the Bible, called Scholey's Bible, in a note
to the commencement of the Acts, very composedly
assure us, that "from its style, and other internal
marks, it is evidently the production of Luke":
quoting for his authority, Bishop of Lincoln's <i>Elements
of Christian Theology</i>, vol. 4. Who this same
Bishop of Lincoln was, by whose Elements of Christian
Theology, instruction such as this is administered,
let those inquire, in whose eyes the profit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
the inquiry promises payment for the trouble. From
any such particular inquiry, the profit will perhaps
appear the less, the greater appears the probability,
that, in the minds of all Bishops,&mdash;from the first that
ever committed his instructions in theology to the
press, down to those by whom the Christian world is
illuminated at this present writing,&mdash;the same sort
of discernment, or the same sort of sincerity, has all
along had place.</p>

<p>When 20,000<i>l</i>, a year&mdash;or though it were but 20<i>l</i>,
once told&mdash;or, though it were but salvation from
everlasting torment&mdash;is to be gained; gained, by the
perception, that two men, the one of whom writes in
point-blank contradiction to the other, are one and
the same man,&mdash;the task is not, naturally speaking,
of the number of those, by the performance of which
much wonder need be excited.</p>

<p>The sort of improvement, made by the author of
the later history, upon the account given in the
earlier, has now been seen. Would anyone wish to
see the inducement? He will not have far to look
for it. For making the impression, which it was his
desire to make,&mdash;the <i>one</i> day, allotted to the occurrence
by one of the company, was not, in the estimation
of the anonymous writer, sufficient. To render
it sufficient, he calls in the powers of arithmetic: he
multiplies the <i>one</i> by forty; and thus, to the unquestionable
satisfaction of a host of mathematicians,&mdash;Barrow,
Newton, and so many other mathematical
divines, not to speak of Locke, of the number&mdash;thus
is done what is required to be done: thus, by so simple
an operation, is the probative force of the occurrence
multiplied forty-fold.<a name="FNanchor_80_86" id="FNanchor_80_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_86" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<h4>SECTION 3.</h4>

<h5>AS TO ASCENSION, ACTS IS INCONSISTENT WITH LUKE.</h5>

<p>Thus far, the embellishments, made by our anonymous
artist, have had for their ground the work of
the original hand: meaning always Saint Luke, with
whom the common error has identified him. Here
comes an instance, in which the whole is altogether
of his own workmanship. This is the story of the
"two men in white apparel," by whom, what, in
his eyes, were the deficiencies in the instruction offered
by Jesus to the witnesses of his ascension, may
be seen supplied.</p>

<p>Still the same delicacy as before: by his own hand
no miracle made: only a quantity of matter, fit for
this purpose, put into the hands of readers; and to
their imagination is left a task so natural and so,
agreeable.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span></p>

<p>Scarcely, after finishing his instructions to his
Apostles, has Jesus ceased to be visible to them,
when, if Acts is to be believed, "two men in white
apparel"&mdash;two men, <i>to</i> whom none of them were
known, and <i>by</i> whom none of them were known, make
their appearance, and from nobody knows where.
But these same two men in white, who are they?
"Oh!" says <i>Imagination</i>, for the hints we have
already seen given to her are quite sufficient, "Oh!"
says Imagination, "they were angels. Think for a
moment, and say what else they can have been.
Had they been men, could they have been thus
unknowing and unknown? could their appearance
have been thus sudden? not less sudden than the
vanishing of a spirit? not to speak of the beautiful
white clothes you see they had,&mdash;and would they
have been thus dressed? To believe them men,
would be to believe in direct contradiction to Saint
Luke; for, in his account of the matter, as you may
see, from first to last, not two men were there in
the whole party, that were not in the most intimate
manner known to each other. But though, by Saint
Luke's account, so decided a negative is put upon
all men-strangers, yet nothing is said about angels.
Angels, therefore, they may have been,&mdash;you may
venture to say they <i>were</i>: and the report made by
all persons present, remains nevertheless uncontradicted."</p>

<p>"Another proof, that they cannot have been men,
and that therefore they were angels. Of these
beings, who were then unknown to all the company,
what was the errand? It was no less than the
giving to the whole company of the companions of
Jesus,&mdash;of that Jesus, by whom, after giving to
them such instructions as he thought fit to give to
them, they had but that moment been left,&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
giving to them some <i>other</i> instructions, which he
had not thought fit, or else had forgot, to give to
them. But, as by no men-strangers could any such
conceit have been entertained, as that, by the party
in question, any such instructions would be listened
to,&mdash;so, by no men-strangers can it be that any such
instructions were given:&mdash;an additional proof that
they cannot have been anything but angels." Thus
readily does the imagination of the reader, answer
with her logic, the call given to her by the imagination
of the author.</p>

<p>Angels if they were, they appear not to have been
very knowing ones. Sent, for the purpose of giving
information,&mdash;and such information, nothing of that
which was known to all those, to whom they came to
give it,&mdash;nothing, if they themselves are to be believed,
was known to them. Addressing themselves
to the company&mdash;the company whom Jesus had but
that moment left,&mdash;"Whom saw ye going up," say
they, ver. 11, "into heaven"? Then comes the information,
which Jesus, on his departure, Jesus, we
are expected to believe, has not thought fit, or else
had forgot, to give. "This same Jesus," say they,
ver. 11, "which is taken up from you into heaven,
shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him
go into heaven." Here we have the information
and&mdash;they to whom it was given,&mdash;what can they
have been the better for it?&mdash;"Shall so come." Yes:
but when and where, and to what end, and what to
do? points these, as to all which, the information is
altogether mute.</p>

<p>One other proof is yet behind. What has been
seen as yet is in the first chapter. The tenth of his
eight and twenty chapters is not finished, where,
speaking in agreement with Saint Luke, he now
disagrees with himself. On this occasion, it is by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
the mouth of Peter that he speaks. "God," he makes
Peter say, Acts 10:41, "God showed him," Jesus,
"openly."&mdash;Showed him, let anybody ask, and to
whom? "Not," says he, "to all the people, but unto
witnesses chosen before of God, even to us who
did eat and drink with him after he rose from the
dead." Thus again it is, that for any men-strangers,
not a particle of room is left. But, for
angels, considering the materials they are made of,
no quantity of room can be insufficient: therefore,
once more, nothing can these men have been but
angels.</p>

been taken, of a similar operation as having been performed by
Paul himself: of the improvement made in <i>that</i> case, the subject
was the number of the witnesses: according to the real Apostle,
who was one of the company, the number, as we have seen, was
eleven, and a few more: this number, whatever it was, the self-constituted
Apostle, who knew nothing about the matter, took in
hand, and multiplied till he had raised it to five hundred. Thus,
with or without concert, with like effect,&mdash;and it is almost needless
to say, with the same object, and from the same inducement,&mdash;may
be seen the master and the journeyman, working on different occasions,
but with well-matched industry, at the manufacturing of
evidence. Add now together the results of the two operations,
and note the aggregate. Number of witnesses, according to Luke,
say,&mdash;for the sake of round numbers,&mdash;twenty; though there seems
little reason to suppose it so great: addition made to it by Paul,
480. Number of days,&mdash;during which, as above, they continued
seeing and hearing what they saw and heard,&mdash;according to Saint
Luke, but one: according to Paul's attendant, 40. Multiply together
the two improvements, that is to say, the 480 by the 40, you have
19,200 for the sum total of probative force, added by the arguments
of the author of the Acts to the amount of the original quantity, as
reported by Saint Luke.</p></div></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3><i>Law Report.&mdash;Jews versus Paul: Trials five, with
Observations.</i></h3>


<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 1.</h4>

<h5>INTRODUCTION.</h5>

<p>On the occasion of what passed at the Temple, the
report of a great law-case,&mdash;to speak in modern and
English language,&mdash;the case of <i>The Jews against
Paul</i>, was begun. The judicatory before which he
underwent that trial,&mdash;partly before the Jewish multitude,
partly before the Roman chief by whom he
was rescued,&mdash;was a sort of mixed and extempore
judicatory, something betwixt a legal and an illegal
one: for, as has been seen in the case of Saint
Stephen, and as may be seen in the case of the woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
taken in adultery, and moreover, in the body of the
law itself, a sort of mob-law might, not altogether
without ground, be stated as forming part and parcel
of the law of Moses. To this sort of irregular trial,
succeeded, before the definite judgment was pronounced,
no fewer than four others, each of them
before a tribunal, as regular as any the most zealous
supporter of what is called legitimacy could desire.
In execution of this definitive judgment it was, that
Paul was sent, on that half-forced, half-voluntary
expedition of his, to Rome: at which place, on his
arrival at that capital, the Acts history closes. Of
the reports of these several trials, as given in the
Acts,&mdash;follows a summary view, accompanied with a
few remarks for elucidation.</p>


<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 2.</h4>

<h5>TRIAL I. PLACE, JERUSALEM TEMPLE.&mdash;JUDICATORY, THE
MIXED MULTITUDE.&mdash;<i>Acts</i> 22:1 to 21.</h5>

<p>Scene, the Temple. Judges, prosecutors, and&mdash;stated
as intended executioners, a Jerusalem multitude.
Sole class, by whom any declared or special
cause of irritation had been received, the Christianized
Jews, provoked by Paul's preachings against the
law of the land, to which they as yet maintained their
adherence; by his intrusion upon their society, by
which, were it only for his former persecution, he
could not but be abhorred; and by the notorious
perjury he was at that moment committing, having
chosen to commit it, rather than cease to obtrude
upon them the object of their abhorrence.</p>

<p>Of the particulars of the accusation nothing is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
said: but, the above circumstances, and the subsequent
charges made upon him the next day by the
constituted authorities,&mdash;who immediately took up
the matter, and carried on a regular prosecution
against him,&mdash;sufficiently show, what, if expressed,
would have been the purport of them. By the preparations
made for execution, we shall see broken off
the defence, before it had come, if ever it was designed
to come, to the substance of the alleged offence.</p>

<p>Points touched upon in it are these:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Defendant's birthplace, Tarsus; parentage,
Jewish; religious persuasion, Pharasaical; education,
under Gamaliel, verse 3.</p>

<p>2. Part, borne by him, in the persecution of the
Christians, when Stephen was stoned: his commission
for that purpose stated, and the High Priest
and Elders called to witness, verses 4 and 5.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>N.B. Time of <i>that</i> same commission, according
to the received chronology, not less than 26
years before this.</p></div>

<p>3. Story, of that first vision, of which so much has
been seen: namely, that from whence his conversion
was dated: occasion, his journey to Damascus, for
the execution of that same commission, verses 6
to 16.</p>

<p>4. Story of his trance: for this see Chapter IV.
. 7. In this state, "the Lord" seen by him.&mdash;<i>Lord
to Defendant.</i> "Get thee quickly out of Jerusalem,
for they will not receive thy testimony concerning
me." <i>Defendant, to Lord.</i> Informing or
reminding said Lord of the details of the part borne
by said defendant in the persecution of Saint
Stephen.&mdash;<i>Lord to Defendant.</i> "Depart, for I will
send thee far hence unto the Gentiles." Note, Defendant
cut short: Lord's patience no match for defendant's
eloquence.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Judges and executioners.</i>&mdash;At the word <i>Gentiles</i>,
exclamation:&mdash;"Away with him ... he is not fit to
live":&mdash;clothes cast off, as in Stephen's case, as if
to prepare for stoning him.<a name="FNanchor_81_87" id="FNanchor_81_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_87" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> "Dust thrown into
the air." Present, chief captain Claudius Lysias,
who commands him to be "brought into the castle,"
and "examined by scourging." While, for this purpose,
they are binding him, on Defendant crying out,
"<i>I am a Roman citizen</i>," the binding ceases, no
scourging commences: the next day he is released,
and the "chief priests and all their council" are
"sent for," and Defendant is "set before them."</p>


<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 3.</h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">TRIAL</span> II. <span class="smcap">JUDICATORY, JERUSALEM COUNCIL-BOARD.</span>&mdash;<i>Acts</i>
23:1 to 10.</h5>

<p>Judges, chief priests in council assembled: present,
the high priests. Prosecutors, the said judge: other
prosecutors, as far as appears, none. In modern
Rome-bred law, this mode of procedure, in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
parts of judge and prosecutor are performed by the
same person, is styled the <i>inquisitorial</i>: in contradistinction
to this, that in which the part of prosecutor
is borne by a different person, is stiled the
<i>accusatorial</i>.</p>

<p>Charges or questions put, not stated.</p>

<p><i>Defendant.</i> "I am a Pharisee ... the son of a
Pharisee. Of the hope and resurrection of the dead
I am called in question."</p>

<p>Thereupon, ver. 9, "great cry" ...&mdash;"Great dissention."
"Chief captain, fearing lest," Defendant,
"Paul should have been pulled in pieces of
them," inuendo the said judges, "commands soldiers,"
who take him back into the castle.</p>

<p>"Cry? dissention?"&mdash;whence all this? Acts has
not here been explicit enough to inform us. As to
Defendant's plea, that it was for believing in the
resurrection that he was prosecuted,&mdash;what could
not but be perfectly known to him was,&mdash;that it
neither was true, nor by possibility could be so.
Among said Judges, parties two&mdash;Pharisees and
Sadducees: Pharisees the predominant. "The Sadducees,"
on this occasion, says ver. 8, "say there is
no resurrection, neither angel nor spirit; but the
Pharisees confess both." Prosecuting a Pharisee
for preaching the resurrection, meaning always the
general resurrection, would have been as if a Church-of-Englandist
Priest were indicted in the King's
Bench, for reading the Athanasian creed. Accordingly&mdash;it
was a stratagem of the Defendant's&mdash;this
same misstatement: such it is expressly stated to
be:&mdash;when defendant "<i>perceived</i>," ver. 6, "that the
one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees,"&mdash;then
it was that he came out with it: and, already
it has been seen, how effectually it answered its
purpose.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span></p>

<p>Enter once more the history of the <i>trance</i>. Note
here the sudden termination of Defendant's first
Jerusalem visit, alias his <i>Reconciliation Visit</i>, and
turn back to Chapter IV. . 7, Cause of it,&mdash;historian
speaking in his own person&mdash;"Grecians," Acts 9:29,
"went about to slay him," for disputing with
them:&mdash;historian, speaking, to wit, here, in defendant's
person, Christianized Jews' disbelief of his
conversion, and of that vision story of his, that he
produced in evidence of it. It is on the occasion
of the just-mentioned Temple trial, that Defendant
is made to come out with it. On that occasion, as
hath been seen, it was of no use: but, in this second
trial, it will be seen to be of prime use. That it
was told over again at this trial is not indeed expressly
said: but, that it was so is sufficiently manifest.
This and no other is the handle which his
supporters in the council lay hold of: and this they
could not have done, had he not, as will be seen
presently, put it into their hands. "The Scribes,"
says ver. 9, "that were of the Pharisees' part, arose,
and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man;
but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let
us not fight against God." Well then&mdash;this spirit,
or this angel, who was he? Who but that spirit,
whom defendant had so manifestly told them of, and
who was no other than that "<i>Lord</i>" of his, whom he
had seen in the trance: in the trance, which, while
the multitude were beating him, invention had furnished
him with for the purpose.</p>

<p>Mark now, how apposite a weapon the Pharisees
found, in this same trance, in their war against the
Sadducees. As to Jesus,&mdash;though from first to last,
so far from being recognized by their sect, he had
been the object of that enmity of theirs under which
he sunk,&mdash;yet, so far as, in general terms, he preached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
the <i>general</i> resurrection,&mdash;his doctrine not only
agreed with theirs, but was of no small use to them:
it was of use to them, against those political rivals,
whose opposition to their sect was the sole cause of
everything that was troublesome to it. As to Paul,&mdash;had
he confined himself, to the speaking of Jesus's
<i>particular</i> resurrection,&mdash;this indeed was what no
Pharisee could be disposed to admit: but if, by
Paul or anyone else, Jesus, or any other person, was
at any time seen in an incorporeal state,&mdash;here was
a piece of evidence on their side. With relation to
any interview of the <i>Apostles</i> with Jesus after his
resurrection, nothing that Paul had to say&mdash;to say
with truth or colour of truth&mdash;was anything more
than <i>hearsay</i> evidence: but, as to that, which on this
occasion, he had been relating about the Lord, whom
he had seen in his trance,&mdash;this, how false soever,
was not only <i>direct</i>, but <i>immediate</i> evidence: evidence,
in the delivery of which, the <i>relating</i> witness
stated himself to have been, with relation to the
alleged fact in question, a <i>percipient</i> witness.</p>

<p>That, on this occasion, Paul dwelt, with any particularity,
on the appearance of Jesus in the flesh
after his resurrection, is not said: and, as it would
not have contributed anything to the purpose, the
less particular the safer and the better. <i>Lord</i> or
not <i>Lord</i>, that which appeared was at any rate a
<i>spirit</i>: and for the war against the Sadducees, a
spirit was all that was wanted: no matter of what
sort.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 4.</h4>

<h5>TRIAL III. PLACE, CSAREA.&mdash;<i>Acts</i> 24:1-23.</h5>

<p>Scene, "Governor" Felix's judicatory. Judge, said
Governor. Prosecutor, Orator Tertullus: Present,
his clients,&mdash;the "High Priest" and "the Elders."
Procedure, accusatorial. Time, "twelve days," ver.
11, "after Trial 1; eleven, after Trial 2."</p>

<p>I. Counsel's Speech&mdash;Points touched upon in it,
these:&mdash;verses 1-4.</p>

<p>1. Opening compliment to Governor Judge.&mdash;His
"providence" and "clemency."</p>

<p>II. 1. Vituperative surplusage, of course, as if in
B. R.: though not paid for, in fees and taxes, by
the sheet.&mdash;Defendant, "a pestilent fellow."</p>

<p>Charges three. To make the matter more intelligible,
had the proceeding been by writing in the
first instance, they might have been styled counts.</p>

<p>2. Charge 1. Defendant "a mover of sedition
among all the Jews throughout the world."</p>

<p>3. Charge 2. Said Defendant "a ringleader of
the sect of the Nazarenes."</p>

<p>4. Charge 3. Defendant "gone about to profane
the temple."</p>

<p>5. Statement made of Trial 2, and the termination
given to it by Roman chief captain Lysias, taking
said Defendant out of their hands, and commanding
accusers' appearance in this court: verses 7, 8.</p>

<p>6. <i>Viva voce</i> evidence accordant: witnesses,
neither quality nor number stated. "And <i>the Jews</i>
also assented, saying that these things were so."
ver. 9.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span></p>

<p><ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'II'">III</ins>. Defendant's defence: verses 10-21.</p>

<p>Points touched upon in it, these:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Defendant's confidence in this his judge.</p>

<p>2. At Jerusalem "to worship" was his errand.
The ostensible one, yes: of the real one,&mdash;supplanting
the Apostles,&mdash;of course nothing said.</p>

<p>3. In the temple, defendant was not "found by
<i>them</i>," by whom? "disputing with any man." Disputing?
No. It was to take the oath&mdash;the seven-days-long
false oath,&mdash;that he went there:&mdash;this, and
nothing else. The priests, in whose keeping he was,
and on whose acceptance the validity and efficacy of
the ceremony depended, were not men to be disputed
with.</p>

<p>4. Defendant not found by them "raising up the
people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city."
ver. 12. No: neither was any such raising charged
upon him: nor would it have suited his purpose.
Seditious <i>acts</i> are one thing; seditious <i>discourses</i>,
another. From seditious acts he had nothing to gain;
from seditious discourses everything: to wit, in so
far as the effect of it was to weaken men's attachment
to the law of the land, and engage them to transfer
it to the schism he had raised in the religion of
Jesus.</p>

<p>5. General denial: but not amounting to <i>Not
Guilty</i>. "Neither <i>can they prove</i> the things whereof
they now accuse me." ver. 13.</p>

<p>6. In verses 14, 15, 16, matter nothing to the
purpose. Orthodox his belief: among the objects
of it, the resurrection: void of offence towards God
and man, his conscience.</p>

<p>7. False pretence&mdash;object of this his visit to Jerusalem&mdash;of
this his <i>Invasion Visit</i>&mdash;falsely stated.
"Now after many years I came to bring alms to my
nation, and offerings." ver. 17.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span></p>

<p>8. When Defendant was "found purified in the
temple," it was "neither with multitude, nor with
tumult." True: but nothing to the purpose: the
priests, in whose boarding-house he was, while the
<i>purifying</i>, that is to say, the eating and paying,
process was carrying on, were not a <i>multitude</i>: nor
would <i>tumult</i> have been either profitable or practicable.</p>

<p>9. The men, who so found Defendant there, were
"certain Jews from Asia," and, if they were accusers
or witnesses, ought to have appeared in that character
on the present occasion. "Who ought," says
ver. 19, "to have been here before thee, and object,
if they had aught against me." Ought? why ought
they? Defendant called no witnesses: by non-appearance
of witnesses, if against him, so far from
being injured, he was benefited. The proceeding, too,
was <i>inquisitorial</i>, not <i>accusatorial</i>: it required no accusers.
Jews of Asia indeed? as if there were any
Jews of Asia, to whom any more natural or legitimate
cause of indignation could have been given by
his misdeeds, than had been given by them to all the
Jews in Jerusalem, not to speak of the rest of the
world, or the Christianized Jews.</p>

<p><ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads '13'">10</ins>. By Defendant's saying to the judges in Trial 2,
that it was for preaching the resurrection that he
stood accused by and before them&mdash;by this, without
anything else, the indignation thereupon expressed
by them against him had been excited. "Or else,"
say verses 20, 21, "let these same here say, if they
have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before
the council, Except it be for this one voice,
that I cried, standing among them, Touching the
resurrection of the dead I am called in question
by you this day."</p>

<p>Follows the judge's decision, "When Felix," says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
ver. 22, "heard these things, having more perfect
knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said,
When Lysias the chief captain shall come down,
I will know the uttermost of your matter." Such
is stated to have been the decision of the judge:
and, so far as regarded what passed on Defendant's
trial before Jerusalem council, it was clearly the only
proper one: a more impartial, as well as, in every
point of view, suitable witness, the case could hardly
have afforded: and, as to the main question, nothing
could be more natural, than that what it had fallen
in Lysias's way on that occasion to observe, might
afford instructive light.</p>

<p>Interlocutory order. Defendant recommitted: but
access to him free for everybody. "And he commanded
a centurion," says ver. 23, "to keep Paul,
and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid
none of his acquaintance to minister, or come
unto him."</p>

<p>In this state continues Paul for "two years": at
which time, says ver. 27, "Porcius Festus came into
Felix's room: and Felix, willing to show the Jews
a pleasure, left Paul bound."</p>

<p>In verses 24, 25, 26, this interval of delay is filled
up with an account, such as it is, of certain intrigues,
of which the Defendant was the subject. The Roman
has a Jewess for his wife. The prisoner is sent for,
and wife shares with husband the benefit of his eloquence.
Self-constituted Apostle preaches: heathen
trembles: trembling, however, prevents not his
"hoping" to get money out of the prisoner, if this
part of the history is to be believed. "And after
certain days," says ver. 24, "when Felix came with
his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for
Paul, and heard him concerning," what is here
called, "the faith in Christ." Faith <i>in Christ</i> indeed?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
After the word <i>faith</i>, the word <i>Christ</i> costs
no more to write than the word <i>Paul</i>: but in whatever
was said about faith by Paul, which would be the
most prominent figure,&mdash;Christ or Paul&mdash;may by
this time be imagined. As for any faith which it
was in the nature of the case, that the Roman heathen
should derive from the Greek Jew's eloquence, it
must have been faith in Paul, and Paul only. Paul
he had seen and heard, Christ he had neither seen
nor heard; nor, for aught that appears, anything concerning
him, till that very time.</p>

<p>"And as he reasoned," says ver. 25, "of righteousness,
temperance, and judgment to come, Felix
trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time,
when I have a convenient season, I will call for
thee. He hoped," continues ver. 26, "that money
should have been given him of Paul, that he might
loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener,
and communed with him."</p>

<h4>SECTION 5.</h4>

<h5>TRIAL IV. PLACE AGAIN, CSAREA.&mdash;<i>Acts</i> 25:1-12.</h5>

<p>Scene, Csarea judicatory.&mdash;Judge, new Roman
governor, Festus. Accusers, "Jews," not named,
sent by the high priest and his colleagues from Jerusalem
to Csarea for the purpose. Defendant still
in the prison at Csarea: Roman judge, at Jerusalem.
Prosecutors, the council there&mdash;petition to have
Defendant brought thither. Judge chooses rather to
go to him at Csarea, than thus send for him to
Jerusalem.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span></p>

<p>According to the <i>historian</i>, it was for the purpose
of causing Defendant to be murdered, in the way to
the judicatory, that the prosecutors were so earnest
as they were to obtain the <i>habeas corpus</i>: according
to <i>probability</i>, it was for any purpose, rather than
that of committing any such outrage upon the authority
of their constituted superior, with an army
at his command. Be this as it may, instead of sending
for Defendant to Jerusalem, the judge returned
himself to Csarea.</p>

<p>"Now," says ver. 1, "when Festus was come into
the province, after three days he ascended from
Csarea to Jerusalem.&mdash;Then the high priest and
the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and
besought him.&mdash;And desired favour against him,
that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying
wait in the way to kill him.&mdash;But Festus answered,
that Paul should be kept at Csarea, and that he
himself would depart shortly thither.&mdash;Let them
therefore, said he, which among you are able, go
down with me, and accuse this man, if there be
any wickedness in him.&mdash;And when he had tarried
among them more than ten days, he went down
unto Csarea; and the next day sitting on the
judgment-seat commanded Paul to be brought."</p>

<p>Charges, not particularized: said of them, not so
much as that they were the same as before. "Many
and grievous complaints against Paul, which they
could not prove": ver. 7&mdash;such is the only account
given of them.</p>

<p>Defence&mdash;points contained in it. As before, no
offence, says ver. 8, against the law&mdash;no offence
against "the temple." One point added, "Nor yet
against Caesar." Good. But how comes this here?
Here we have a defence, against what, it is plain, was
never charged.</p>

<p><i>Festus</i>&mdash;judge, to Defendant, ver. 9: "Wilt thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these
things <i>before me</i>?"</p>

<p>Defendant to judge, ver. 10: "I stand at Caesar's
judgment-seat, where I ought to be judged": meaning,
as appears from the direct words of appeal in
the next verse,&mdash;by a Roman, not by a Jewish judicatory,
ought I to be tried. Against the being judged
at Csarea, instead of Jerusalem, he could not naturally
have meant to object: at least, if the historian
speaks true, in what he says about the plot for
murdering the prisoner on the road.</p>

<p>2. "To the Jews," says ver. 10, "have I done no
wrong." Thus far nothing more is said than <i>Not
Guilty</i>. But now follows another trait of that effrontery,
which was so leading a feature in Paul's
eloquence, "as," continues he, "thou very well knowest."
Now what anybody may see is,&mdash;that Festus
neither did know, nor could know, any such thing.
Witness the historiographer himself, who, but eight
verses after, (18, 19, 20,) makes Festus himself, in
discourse with King Agrippa, declare as much. But
the more audacious, the more in Defendant's character;
and the greater the probability, that, in the
conflict between the Law-Report and the narrative,
truth is on the side of the Report.</p>

<p>3. Conclusion: ver. 11, defendant gives judge to
understand, that if he, the Defendant, has done any
of the things he has been charged with, he has no
objection to be put to death: but in the same breath
ends with saying, "I appeal to Caesar!" submitting
thus to Festus's judgment, whatever it may be, and
at the same time appealing from it.</p>

<p>Festus judge: ver. 12, "when he had conferred
with <i>the council</i>," whoever they were,&mdash;"Hast thou
appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar thou shalt go."
Here ends Trial IV.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span></p>


<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 6.</h4>

<h5>TRIAL V. AND LAST.&mdash;PLACE, STILL CSAREA.</h5>

<p>This requires some previous explanation.</p>

<p>A few days after the last preceding trial, came to
Csarea, says verse 13, <i>Agrippa and Bernice</i>: Festus
being still there: Agrippa, sub-king of the Jews
under the Romans: Bernice, it may be presumed, his
queen: saluting this their superior, their only business
mentioned. Follows thereupon a conversation,
of which Defendant is the subject, and which continues
the length of fourteen verses. Defendant having
appealed to Caesar, judge has determined to send
him to Caesar accordingly. But, considering that, by
the emperor, on the arrival of a man sent to him in
the character of a prisoner, some assigned cause, for
his having been put into that condition, will naturally
be looked for; and, as the only offences, the Jew
stands charged with, are of a sort, which, while to
the heathen emperor they would not be intelligible,
would to a Jew sub-king, if to any one, be sufficiently
so;&mdash;thereupon it is, that he desires his sub-majesty
to join with him in the hearing of the cause, and
by that means put him in a way to report upon it.</p>

<p>Speaking of the accusers, "they brought," says
Festus to Agrippa in verse 18, "none accusation of
such things as I supposed.&mdash;But had certain questions
against him of their own superstition, and of
one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to
be alive.&mdash;And because I doubted of such manner of
questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem,
and there be judged of these matters.&mdash;But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
Paul...had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing
of Augustus...." Such, as above noticed, is
the declaration which the historian puts into the
mouth of Festus: and this, after having so recently
made Paul tell Festus, that his, Paul's, having done
no wrong to the Jews, was to him, Festus, matter of
such perfect knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_82_88" id="FNanchor_82_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_88" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span></p>

<p>Now then comes the trial, Acts 26:1. Scene, at
Csarea, the Emperor's Bench. Lord chief justice,
Roman governor Festus; Puisne judge, Jew sub-king
Agrippa. Present, "Bernice...chief captains and
principal men of the city." Special accusers, none.
Sole speaker, whose speech is reported, the Defendant.</p>

<p>Points in Defendant's speech, these:</p>

<p>1. Verses 2 and 3. Patient hearing requested,
acknowledgment of Agrippa's special confidence.</p>

<p>2. Verses 4 and 5. Protestation of Phariseeism.</p>

<p>3. Verses 6, 7, 8. Same false insinuation as before,&mdash;Phariseeism
the sole crime imputed to him.</p>

<p>4. Verses 9, 10, 11. Confession or avowal, whichever
it is to be called, of his proceedings six-and-twenty
years before, against the Christianized Jews,
shutting them up in prison, in pursuance of authority
from "the chief priests," down to the time of his
conversion-vision. See Table I. Conversion Table.</p>

<p>5. Verses 12 to 20. Account of this same vision.
See that same Table.</p>

<p>6. Declaration. "For <i>these</i> causes the Jews caught
me in the temple, and went about to kill me."&mdash;For
these causes? For what causes? If for being
a Pharisee, or preaching the general resurrection, or
even the particular one,&mdash;assuredly no. But, if for
the breach of trust, in joining with the state offenders,
the Christianized Jews, whom he was commissioned
to apprehend;&mdash;joining with those state
offenders, and then bringing out the vision-story for
an excuse;&mdash;if telling everybody that would hear him,
that the law of the land was a dead letter;&mdash;and, if
the denying he had ever done so; and, for giving
himself the benefit of such mendacious denial, rendering
the temple an instrument of notorious perjury;&mdash;if
it was for all this, that they "went about" indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
"to kill him,"&mdash;but to kill him no otherwise than in
the manner prescribed by that same law,&mdash;Jewishly
speaking, they were not to blame in what they did,&mdash;humanly
speaking, nothing can be seen that is not
altogether natural in it.</p>

<p>7. Conclusion: namely, if not of what he would
have said,&mdash;at any rate, of what, according to the
reporter, he was permitted to say:&mdash;it is formed by
a passage, in which, in continuance of his plan for
keeping up his interest with the Pharisee part of the
council, his ingenuity employs itself in strengthening
the connection between the particular resurrection of
Jesus, and the general resurrection maintained by
the Pharisees.</p>

<p>"Having therefore," says verse 22, "obtained help
of God, I continue unto this day, <i>witnessing</i> both
to small and great, saying none other things than
those which the prophets and Moses did say should
come:&mdash;That Christ should suffer, and that he
should be the first that should rise from the dead,
and should show light unto the people, and to the
Gentiles."&mdash;Lord Chief Justice Festus, "with a
loud voice, as he," the Defendant, "thus spake for
himself&mdash;Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning
hath made thee mad." In the mouth of a
Roman, and that Roman so high in rank, the notion
thus expressed had nothing in it but what was natural
enough. As to the <i>general</i> resurrection, <i>that</i> was
one of the above-mentioned "questions about their
own superstition," which he therefore left to the
Jewish judges: as to the <i>particular</i> resurrection, of
this he had heard no better evidence than the defendant's:
and what, in discriminating eyes, <i>that</i> was
likely to be worth, the reader has by this time judged.</p>

<p>8. Defendant in reply, ver. 25: Not mad, but sober:&mdash;for
confirmation, appeal to the Jewish sub-monarch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
then and there present. "I am not mad, most
noble Festus; but speak for the words of truth
and soberness.&mdash;For the King knoweth of these
things, before whom also I speak freely; for I am
persuaded, that none of these things are hidden
from him; for this was not done in a corner." Here
would have been a place for the five hundred, by
whom, after his resurrection, Jesus was seen at once&mdash;see
above chapter&mdash;but, upon the present occasion,
the general expression, here employed, was deemed
preferable. "King Agrippa," continues verse 27,
"believest thou the prophets? I know that thou
believest."</p>

<p>King Agrippa to Paul, ver. 28. "Almost thou
persuadest me to be a Christian."</p>

<p>Paul to Agrippa: "I would to God, that not only
thou, but also all that hear me this day were both
almost and altogether such as I am, <i>except these
bonds</i>." No bad trait of polite oratory this exception.</p>

<p>Assembly breaks up.&mdash;"And when he had thus
spoken, the King rose up, and the governor and
Bernice, and they that sat with them. And when
they were gone aside, they talked between themselves,
saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of
death or of bonds. Then said Agrippa unto Festus,
This man might have been set at liberty, if he had
not appealed unto Caesar." Observation. In this
observation, something of the obscure seems to present
itself. For, Paul himself being the appellant,
and <i>that</i> for no other purpose than the saving himself
from death or bonds, he had but to withdraw
the appeal, and, supposing a judgment pronounced to
the effect thus mentioned, this was everything he
could have wished from it. But, Paul having already,
to judge from his Epistle to the Romans, laid the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
foundation of a spiritual kingdom in the metropolis
of the civilized world,&mdash;it looks as if he had no objection
to figure there, as we shall find him figuring
accordingly, in the character of a state-prisoner, for
the purpose of displaying, and in the eye of the
Caesar of that day, a sample of his eloquence, in a
cause so much greater than any in which that of the
first Caesar could ever have displayed itself. Reason
is not wanting for the supposition, that it was by
what passed at the council, that the idea was first
suggested to him: for "the night following, the
Lord," says 23:11, "stood by him, and said, Be of
good cheer, Paul; for as thou hast testified of me
in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at
Rome." The Lord has commanded me so and so,
is the sort of language in which he would naturally
make communication of this idea to his attendants.</p>

<p>The circumstantiated and dramatic style of this
part of the narrative, seems to add to the probability,
that, on this occasion, the historian himself was
present. On this supposition, though in the Greek
as well as in the English, they are represented as
if they had quitted the justice-room,&mdash;any conversation,
that took place among them immediately after,
in the street, might not unnaturally have been overheard
by him. In chapter 24, ver. 23, stands Felix's
order of admittance, as above, for Paul's acquaintance,
to minister or come to him. One other attendant
has appeared, in the character of his sister's
son, Acts 23:16; by whom information was given to
Felix, that the men there spoken of were lying in
wait for him to kill him. On the occasion of this
invasion of his, it would have been interesting enough
to have had a complete list of his staff.</p>

<p>Here ends trial fifth and last: and in the next verse
it is, that, together with other prisoners, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
historian at least for his free attendant, he is dispatched
on his voyage. Acts 27:1. "And when it
was determined that we should sail into Italy, they
delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one
named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band.&mdash;And
entering into a ship of Adramyttium, <i>we</i>
launched...."</p>

with torturing a man, and proceed by questioning him, was, however,
among the Romans a well-known mode of obtaining evidence. But,

"Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered,
Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.&mdash;And
after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Csarea
to salute Festus.&mdash;And when they had been there many days, Festus
declared Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man
left in bonds by Felix:&mdash;About whom, when I was at Jerusalem,
the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring
to have judgment against him.&mdash;To whom I answered, It is not
the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that
he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have
license to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against
him.&mdash;Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay
on the morrow I sat on the judgment-seat, and commanded the
man to be brought forth:&mdash;Against whom, when the accusers stood
up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:&mdash;But
had certain questions against him of their own superstition,
and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.&mdash;And
because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him
whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these
matters.&mdash;But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing
of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send
him to Caesar.&mdash;Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear
the man myself. To-morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.&mdash;And
on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great
pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief
captains and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment
Paul was brought forth.&mdash;And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all
men which are present with us, ye see this man about whom all
the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem
and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.&mdash;But
when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and
that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to
send him.&mdash;Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord,
wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially
before thee, O, King Agrippa, that after examination had, I might
have somewhat to write.&mdash;For it seemeth to me unreasonable to
send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against
him."</p></div></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<h3><i>Paul's Doctrines Anti-apostolic</i>.&mdash;<i>Was he not
Anti-Christ?</i></h3>


<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 1.</h4>

<h5>PAUL'S DOCTRINE WAS AT VARIANCE WITH THAT OF
THE APOSTLES.</h5>

<p>If Paul's pretensions to a supernatural intercourse
with the Almighty were no better than a pretence;&mdash;his
visit to Jerusalem, from first to last, an object
of abhorrence to the Apostles and all their disciples;
in a word, to all, who in the birthplace of Christianity,
bore the name of Christian, and were regarded as
belonging to the religion of Jesus;&mdash;if, not only to
<i>their</i> knowledge, but to that of the whole population
of Jerusalem, he was a depraved character, marked
by the stain,&mdash;not merely of habitual insincerity, but
of perjury in its most aggravated form;&mdash;if it was
no otherwise than by his having declared himself a
Roman citizen, that he escaped from the punishment&mdash;apparently
a capital one&mdash;attached by the law of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
the land to the crimes of which he had been guilty;
if, in a word, it was only in places, in which Jesus&mdash;his
doctrines, and his Apostles&mdash;were alike unknown,
that this self-declared Apostle of Jesus was received
as such;&mdash;if all, or though it were but some, of these
points may be regarded as established,&mdash;any further
proof, in support of the position, that no doctrine of
his, which is not contained in some one or other of
the four Gospels, has any pretension to be regarded
as part and parcel of the religion of Jesus, might
well, in any ordinary case, be regarded as superfluous:
and, of the several charges here brought to
view, whether there be any one, of the truth of which
the demonstration is not complete, the reader has all
along been invited to consider with himself, and
judge. If thereupon the judgment be condemnatory,
the result is&mdash;that whatever is in Paul, and is not to
be found in any one of the four Gospels, is not Christianity,
but Paulism.</p>

<p>In any case of ordinary complexion, sufficient then,
it is presumed, to every judicious eye, would be what
the reader has seen already: but the present case is
no ordinary case. An error, if such it be, which
notwithstanding all the sources of correction, which
in the course of the work have at length been laid
open and brought to view, has now, for upwards of
seventeen centuries past, maintained its ground
throughout the Christian world, cannot, without the
utmost reluctance, be parted with: for dissolving the
association so unhappily formed, scarcely, therefore,
can any argument which reason offers be deemed
superfluous.</p>

<p>For this purpose, one such argument, though on
a preceding occasion already touched upon, remains
to be brought to view. It consists of his own confession.
Confession? say rather avowal: for&mdash;such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
is the temper of the man&mdash;in the way of boasting it
is, not in the way of concession and self-humiliation
that he comes out with it. Be this as it may&mdash;when,
speaking of the undoubted Apostles, he himself declares,
that he has received nothing from them, and
that he has doctrines which are not theirs, shall he
not obtain credence? Yes: for this once, it should
seem, he may, without much danger of error, be taken
at his word.</p>

<p>To see this&mdash;if he can endure the sight&mdash;will not
cost the reader much trouble, Table II. <i>Paul disbelieved
Table</i>, lies before him. Under the head of
<i>Independence declared</i>, in Paul's Epistle to his Galatians,
chapter 1, verses 11, 12, he will find these
words. "But I certify you, brethren, that the Gospel
which was <i>preached of me is not after man</i>:
for <i>I neither received it of man</i>, neither was <i>I
taught, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ</i>."
Thus far Paul. If then it was not received by him
by the revelation of Jesus Christ&mdash;this Gospel of his;
nor yet, as he assures us, "<i>of man</i>,"&mdash;the consequence
is a necessary one&mdash;it was made by him, out
of his own head.</p>


<hr class="r5" />
<h4>SECTION 2.</h4>

<h5>OF CONFORMITY, USE MADE OF THE NAME OF JESUS
NO PROOF.</h5>

<p>Of the name of Jesus, whatever use he may have
made&mdash;made (as it was seen) without authority&mdash;can
any use, made in contradiction to this his own confession,
afford any the slightest ground for regarding
<i>his</i> Gospel, whatever it be,&mdash;his Gospel, or any part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
of it,&mdash;as belonging to the religion of Jesus? If so,
then are all impostors the persons they falsely pretend
to be&mdash;all counterfeit productions of any kind,
genuine ones.</p>

<p>While preaching to Gentiles at a distance from
Jerusalem, from any use he could have the assurance
to make of so revered a name, it is almost superfluous
to observe, how much he had to gain, and how
little to lose. In a case of this sort, how much soever
there may be that is offensive in the demeanour of
the pretended agent eulogizing, no part of it is
ascribed to the pretended principal eulogized: and,
in such his eulogy, the pretended agent is not
hampered by any of those considerations, by which
he would stand precluded from all prospect of advantage,
had he the effrontery to lay it in equally
strong colours on himself. Thus, in the case of Paul,
from putting in the foreground where he did, the
name of Jesus, there was this great advantage to
gain: and, the pretended principal being never present
to disavow him, the consequence was&mdash;that, so
long as no accredited and credited agents, of that
same principal, were at hand to contradict his pretensions,&mdash;the
mere name of this principal would be
no obstacle, to the preaching of doctrines, ever so
decidedly at variance with his.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand,&mdash;in a company, in which he
was preaching doctrines of his own, which were not
Jesus's,&mdash;men should happen to be present, to whom,
by reason of their personal acquaintance with Jesus,
or with any immediate disciples of Jesus, these same
doctrines of Paul's should be perceived and declared
not to be Jesus's, here would be an inconvenience:
and, on this account,&mdash;wherever, without using the
name of Jesus, or any other name than his own, he
could be sufficiently assured, of obtaining a degree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
of confidence sufficient for his purpose,&mdash;this course,
supposing it successful, would, on several accounts,
be more advantageous.</p>

<p>Here then, on each occasion, or at any rate on some
occasions, would be an option for him to make:
namely, either to preach in the name of Jesus, or else
to set up for himself:&mdash;to set up for himself, and,
on the strength of a pretended revelation from the
Almighty, without the intervention of Jesus, preach
in no other human name than his own.</p>

<p>From a passage, in the first of his two Epistles to
his Corinthian disciples, it looks as if an experiment
of this kind&mdash;an experiment for adding nominal independence
to real&mdash;had actually been tried: but that,
the success of it was not such as to be followed by
continuance. For this suspicion&mdash;for it is but a suspicion,&mdash;any
reader who thinks it worth his while
may see the grounds in the subjoined note.<a name="FNanchor_83_89" id="FNanchor_83_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_89" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<h4>SECTION 3.</h4>

<h5>PAUL, WAS HE NOT ANTICHRIST?</h5>

<p>A child, of Paul's ready and fruitful brain&mdash;a bugbear,
which the officious hands of the English official
translators of his Epistles, have in their way christened,
so to speak, by the name of <i>Antichrist</i>,&mdash;has
been already brought to view. See Chap. XII. . 4.
If there be any persons, to whose religion,&mdash;in addition
to a devil, with or without horns and tail,&mdash;with
or without other spirits, in no less carnal howsoever
unrepulsive forms,&mdash;an Antichrist is necessary for
the completion of the polytheistical official establishment;
and if, in place of an ideal, they can put up
with a real Antichrist,&mdash;an Antichrist of flesh and
blood,&mdash;they need not go far to look for one. Of
Saul, alias Paul, the existence is not fabulous. If,
in his time, a being there was, in whom, with the
exception of some two or three attendants of his own,
every person, that bore the name of Christian, beheld,
and felt an opponent, and that opponent an indefatigable
adversary, it was this same Paul: Yes, such
he was, if, in this particular, one may venture to give
credence, to what has been seen so continually testified,&mdash;testified,
not by any enemy of his, but by his
own dependent,&mdash;his own historiographer,&mdash;his own
panegyrist,&mdash;his own steady friend. Here then, for
anybody that wants an Antichrist, here is an Antichrist,
and he an undeniable one.</p>

<p>Antichrist, as everybody sees, Antichrist means
neither more nor less than that which is opposed to
Christ. To Christ himself, the bugbear, christened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
by the English bishops <i>Antichrist</i>, was not, by its
creator, spoken of as opposing itself. To Christ
himself, Paul himself could not, at that time, be an
opponent: the Jesus, whom he called Christ, was no
longer in the flesh. But of all that, in the customary
figurative sense&mdash;of all that, in any intelligible sense,
could on this occasion be called <i>Christ</i>&mdash;namely, the
real Apostles of Jesus, and their disciples and followers,&mdash;Paul,
if he himself is to be believed, was an
opponent, if ever there was one.</p>

<p>Paul preached the resurrection of the dead.
Agreed. But did not all Pharisees do so, too? And
was not Paul a Pharisee? And Jesus&mdash;had he not in
all Pharisees so many opponents? And the real
Christians, had they anywhere in his lifetime, any
other opponent so acrid or so persevering as this
same Paul?</p>

<p>Paul preached the resurrection of the dead.
Agreed. But <i>that</i> resurrection of the dead which he
preached, was it not a resurrection, that was to take
place in the lifetime of himself and other persons
then living? And&mdash;any such resurrection, did it
accordingly take place?<a name="FNanchor_84_90" id="FNanchor_84_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_90" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>
<hr class="tb" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span></p>
<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_83_89" id="Footnote_83_89"></a><a href="#FNanchor_83_89"><span class="label">[83]</span></a> "Were ye baptized," says he, speaking to his Corinthians,
2 Cor. ii. 13. "Were ye baptized in the name of Paul?&mdash;I thank
God," continues he, "that I baptized none of you but Crispus and
Gaius,&mdash;Lest any man should say that I had baptized in mine own
name.&mdash;And I baptized also the household of Stephanas; besides,
I know not whether I baptized any other." For an experiment of
this kind, it should seem from that Epistle, that motives were by no
means wanting. For, among these same disciples, in the preaching
of his doctrines, he had found himself annoyed by divers names
more or less formidable: there was the name, though probably never
the person&mdash;of <i>Cephas</i>, the real Hebrew name, of which, in the four
Gospels, written as they are in Greek, <i>Peter</i> is the translation: there
was the name, and not improbably the person&mdash;of <i>Apollos</i>, whom,
about three years before, Acts 18:18-26, two female disciples of
Paul's, Aquila and Priscilla, had at Ephesus enlisted under his
banners: there was, according to him, <i>the name of Christ</i>, though
assuredly, never the person of <i>Jesus</i>.
</p>

<p>"For it hath been declared unto me of you, brethren," says he,
1 Cor. i. 11, "that there are contentions among you,&mdash;Now this I
say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos;
and I of Cephas; and I of Christ." Thereupon follows immediately
a short flourish of Paulian eloquence:&mdash;"Is Christ divided? was Paul
crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?" and
so forth, as above.
</p>

<p>"Division," says he, "among you:" in this phrase may be seen
the style of modern royalty. Towards a will so intimately connected
with the divine as the royal, no such temper of mind, so intolerable
as opposition, is ever to be supposed: were it on all occasions
equally known&mdash;known to all, and alike interpreted by all, no division
could have place: but, some put one interpretation upon it, some
another: in some eyes, this course is regarded as best adapted to the
giving effect to it; in others, that: hence that division, to which, on
every occasion, it is the duty of all to put the speediest end. Now
then as to Paul. This same assumed fatherly affection, under the
name of elder-brotherly&mdash;this desire of seeing concord among
brethren&mdash;what was it in plain truth? Answer, love of power.
Would you have proof? Take in hand this same Epistle of his to
his Corinthians, or, if at verse the tenth, it will be to this purpose
early enough, and read on, till you come to chapter iv. verses 15, 16.
"Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions
among you: but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same
mind, and in the same judgment.&mdash;For it hath been declared unto
me," and so forth, as above. Read on, and at length you will come
to the essence of all this good advice, 1 Cor. 4:15. "For, though
ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ," says he, "yet have ye
not many fathers; for, in Christ Jesus, <i>I have begotten you</i>, through
the Gospel.&mdash;Wherefore, I beseech you, <i>be ye followers of me</i>."
</p>

<p>At this time, it should seem that, on the occasion of this his
courtship of the Jews of Corinth, not only was the name of Peter
an object of his declared rivalry, but the name and person of his
own sub-disciple Apollos, an object of his jealousy. "For, while
one saith," 1 Cor. iii. 4, "I am of Paul; and another, I am of
Apollos; are ye not," says he, "carnal?&mdash;Who then," continues he,
"is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed,
even as the Lord gave to every man?&mdash;I have planted, Apollos
watered; but God gave the increase.&mdash;Now he that planteth and he
that watereth are one; and every man shall receive his own reward
according to his own labour." Fifteen verses after comes a flourish,
in which Apollos is spoken of for the last time. "Whether Paul,
or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things
present, or things to come, all are yours;&mdash;23. And ye are Christ's,
and Christ is God's." At the word <i>Cephas</i> ends, it may have been
observed, common sense: what follows being dust for the eyes: dust,
composed of the flowers of Saulo-Paulian eloquence.
</p>

<p>As to Apollos, if so it was, that, at one time, in the mind of our
spiritual monarch, any such sentiment as jealousy, in regard to this
sub-minister had place, it seems to have been afterwards, in some
way or other, removed: for, in his Epistle to Titus, bearing date
about seven years after, namely A.D. 64, the devotion of the subject
seems to have been entire. Speaking to Titus, Tit. 3:13, "Bring
with you," says Paul, "Zenas the lawyer, and Apollos, on their
journey diligently, that nothing be wanting to them."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_84_90" id="Footnote_84_90"></a><a href="#FNanchor_84_90"><span class="label">[84]</span></a> Paul must have thought that he had the Church at Corinth
under complete control of his hypnotic suggestion or otherwise
so much under his control as to assume the exalted office of
Clairvoyant Oracle without question. He says, 2 Cor. 1-7, "I must
needs glory, though it is not expedient; but I will come to visions
and revelations of the Lord, I know a man in Christ, fourteen
years ago (whether in the body I know not; or whether out of
the body, I know not, God knoweth). Such a one caught up
even to the third heaven. And I know such a man (whether in
the body, or apart from the body, I know not, God knoweth);
how that he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable
words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter. On behalf of
such a one will I glory: but on mine own behalf I will not glory,
save in my weakness. For if I should desire to glory, I shall not
be foolish; for I shall speak the truth: but I forbear, lest any
man should account of me above that which he seeth me to be,
or heareth from me.
</p>
<p>
"And by reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations&mdash;wherefore,
that I should not be exalted overmuch, there was
given to me <i>a thorn in the flesh</i>, a messenger of Satan to buffet
me, that I should not be exalted overmuch. Concerning this
thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.
</p>
<p>
"And he has said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee."
</p>
<p>
It would require a Swift, Dryden, Pope, Milton or Knowles to
stage the above so as make appreciable objective quantities out
of the above verbal terms. They might create characters and give
them the plumage of angels, nymphs, spirits, heathen gods, etc.,
and so feast the imagination into paranoia.
</p>
<p>
"Thorn in the flesh." This phrase has baffled the Ecclesiastics.
The earlier Commentators interpreted it to mean Paul's great disappointment
in all his schemes to subordinate the Apostles of Christ
to his personal dominion of which so much has been disparaged
by the author.</p></div></div>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
